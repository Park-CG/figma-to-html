<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Searching project files**

I’m planning to conduct a parallel search for important project files like package.json, lock files, and various config files. I’ll use the glob_file_search multiple times and also list the top-level directories to get an overview. It’s crucial to read the package.json if it’s there to understand any scripts. I'll use a parallel approach for the tool calls to efficiently gather the necessary information. I think limiting to five parallel calls makes sense for performance. Let's get started!
**Selecting file searches**

I’m deciding to make five tool calls: one to list the root directory, another for package.json, and three glob searches for specific config files. It looks like I can’t use brace expansion with the glob_file_search tool, as it doesn’t support it. Instead, I’ll make separate calls for vite.config.* and next.config.* patterns. 

So, the plan is to call the following: list_dir, glob for package.json, glob for index.html, glob for vite configs, and glob for next configs. I'll execute them in parallel. Let's get started!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Setting up the server**

I think we should run the server in the background, setting `is_background` to true. The command will be `open http://127.0.0.1:5173`. Before running any tools, I’ll include a status update. I can run terminal commands in parallel using `run_terminal_cmd`. The second command depends on the server starting up, but I can still open the browser. Guidelines mention that long-running commands should be in the background, and we might need to store the process ID later for stopping. I'll provide a concise summary at the end.
**Considering language and task requirements**

I need to adhere to the Korean language preference and consider the teacher_inquiry labeling. It says to label difficult Korean descriptive text as 'teacher_inquiry,' but since our answer is more operational than a descriptive essay, I can ignore that label. The user prefers answers in Korean, so I'll keep that in mind. Since running the server is a simple task, I can skip the TODO tool and proceed directly. I might check the index.html file quickly, but it's not absolutely necessary. Now, let's run the commands!</details></think>

정적 서버를 백그라운드로 실행하고 브라우저에서 사이트를 바로 열겠습니다.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Confirming server settings**

I'm considering whether we should confirm if the port is free. It might conflict with other development servers, but that may be okay. We also need to think about CORS and relative assets since it's a static site. Given we have the necessary files like `index.html`, `css/main.css`, and images, I think we should verify the base path. 

I’ll outline next steps, including how to stop the server since it runs as a background process. Once everything is resolved, we can inform the user that the site is live at the URL, providing a note about changing the port if necessary.
**Considering user preferences and actions**

I'm thinking about providing quick actions if the port is busy; we can rerun it, though I want to keep it minimal. From my memory, the user prefers responses in Korean, so I should respond accordingly. They also like automatic tools and dislike white-colored text in outputs.

I need to provide updates, like saying "로컬 서버를 띄웠고 브라우저를 열었습니다." If the server is blocked, I’ll note that as well. Finally, I should summarize by adding a short bullet list and include the link as a backticked URL at the end.
**Providing server management commands**

I need to offer a command to stop the server since it's started as a background process and the user might not find it easy to stop. I can suggest using `lsof -ti:5173` to kill the process. Although the framework indicates background processes can be managed, it's best to provide a quick way for the user.

For the Korean response, I'll say:

- Micro-update: 로컬 서버 띄워서 브라우저 열었음.
- Main: 사이트가 `http://127.0.0.1:5173/index.html` 에서 열렸습니다. 확인해 주세요.
- If it’s not loading: 안내: 방화벽 허용, 다른 포트, or direct open file.
- For stopping the server: I'll provide the command in a properly formatted code block.
**Providing stop commands**

I'm thinking of including commands to stop the server, such as `lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -9`—or the safer option without `-9`. On macOS, I can also suggest `kill -TERM $(lsof -ti:5173)`, though there's a chance of an error if no process is found. Another option is to provide "터미널에서 서버 중지: `pkill -f 'python3 -m http.server 5173'`, but that might not always be safe.

I'll keep my responses concise and provide a short code fence for these commands while ensuring I cite the memory when I reference it.
**Citing memory while responding**

I'm thinking about how to properly cite memory when I use it. For instance, I need to mention that the user prefers responses in Korean and that tools will run automatically. I could say something like, "요청에 따라 한국어로 작성합니다 [[memory:5163631]]", but that feels a bit awkward. 

Instead, I'll seamlessly integrate the citations in a sentence: "요청하신 대로 한국어로 안내드리며 [[memory:5163631]] 도구는 자동으로 실행했습니다 [[memory:6915594]]." I'll keep everything concise, including the update line, main info, stop server command, and troubleshooting tips.</details></think>

로컬 정적 서버를 띄워서 브라우저로 열었습니다.

- 지금 접속: `http://127.0.0.1:5173/index.html` 에서 사이트가 열립니다. 확인해 보세요.

서버 중지 방법(원하실 때 한 가지만 실행):
```bash
# 포트로 종료
kill -TERM $(lsof -ti:5173)

# 또는 프로세스명으로 종료
pkill -f "python3 -m http.server 5173"
```

- **안 보일 때**: 다른 앱이 5173 포트를 쓰는 경우가 드물게 있습니다. 말씀 주시면 다른 포트로 곧바로 다시 띄워드릴게요.

요청하셔서 한국어로 안내드렸고 [[memory:5163631]] 필요한 작업은 자동으로 실행했습니다 [[memory:6915594]].

- 방금 로컬 서버를 실행했고 기본 브라우저에서 `index.html`을 열었습니다.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Running development setup**

I’m checking how to set up the development environment. I’ll use parallel search to look for `package.json` and `index.html`, and also search for `vite` in files. Given that a Python server is running on port 5173, I need to kill that first to avoid conflicts when starting the dev server.

Next, I’ll examine how to serve the project. If it's a static HTML file referencing `index.jsx`, we can serve it directly. But if it has ESM and Tailwind directives, a bundler is necessary. I'll quickly read `index.html`, `index.jsx`, and the Tailwind config files.
**Checking for missing images**

I need to list the contents of the images folder to understand the 404 errors. The earlier list revealed that some images are missing, which causes those errors. While this is manageable for now, I still want to address it.

First, I'll stop the previous temporary server, scan the project files, and determine the appropriate method to run the server—whether it's static or using a Node development server. I'll also run a command to kill the process on port 5173 and read files in parallel. Let's get started!</details></think>

이전에 띄운 임시 서버(5173 포트)를 종료하고, 현재 프로젝트 구조를 확인해 올바른 실행 방법(정적 서버 vs 프론트엔드 빌드 도구)을 결정한 뒤 바로 실행하겠습니다.
