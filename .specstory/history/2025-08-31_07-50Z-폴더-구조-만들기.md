<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering project structure**

I’m thinking about how the workspace may not want to generate `package.json` and `vite.config.js` unless they're needed. It might be okay to create empty versions, but that could clash with an existing project. The request is to build a structure, involving just src and component files, along with a `.gitignore`. The screenshot shows those root-level files, suggesting they might want a complete replication. To avoid issues, I could create directories and files under `src` and `screens`, and maybe add placeholder files if needed.
**Planning the project setup**

I think the user might be expecting a Vite + Tailwind template, but for now, we’re just focusing on replicating the structure with minimal files. The screenshot shows that we should include `index.html`, `package.json`, `README.md`, `tailwind.config.js`, `tailwind.css`, and `vite.config.js`. I’ll create these only if they’re missing. 

Since the folder structure task is simple, I might skip the todo list and just run a command to create the directories, displaying a brief update in Korean. After executing, I want to confirm and use `find` to show the structure.
**Constructing command sequence**

I want to run a command to print the project structure after creating the necessary directories. I can chain multiple commands using `&&` and `;`, but it seems the tool only accepts one command at a time. My approach will be to create the directories, run `printf`, and then use `find` to list the structure.

However, I should avoid creating `package.json` to prevent breaking anything, even though it's in the screenshot. It seems like including `package.json` with `touch package.json` might be necessary to match the user's request.
**Finalizing project setup**

If a `package.json` already exists, using `touch` won't change its content, which is good. If it doesn't exist, creating an empty one could lead to issues later, especially during npm actions. However, since the project is titled "figma-to-html," it might not be a Node project, so including `package.json` should be fine.

I’ll run the command through `functions.run_terminal_cmd`, ensuring to use `cd` first to navigate to the directory. Before executing, I'll add a status update in Korean, letting the user know what I'm doing.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Verifying file structure**

I see that `ValuesSection.jsx` is located under `ElementLight`, which we created. Now, I need to confirm that the dotfile exists by running `ls -Ra` to include hidden files. The instructions mention parallel tool calls, but I think one command will suffice for this. Before running it, I’ll provide my first micro-update and another before any additional commands. 

Once I show the directory structure, I’ll summarize the created files and ask if the user wants sample boilerplate for those JSX files.
**Running terminal commands**

The spec advises against pausing for approval, but adding code might go beyond the task, so I think it’s fine to propose it as optional. I need to run a command to print the directory tree, including dotfiles. Since the `tree` command may not be installed, I could use `find . -maxdepth 5 -print` instead—though it should be non-interactive with `| cat` appended. I’ll also remember to use absolute paths where possible. I don’t think I need to update todos since this is a single-step task.
**Executing the command**

I’m ready to run an extra command to navigate to the `figma-to-html` directory. I’ll use `printf` to introduce the output, and then use `find` to display the tree structure, including dotfiles, limited to a maximum depth of 4. It's crucial that I keep the command from running indefinitely. So, I’ll execute that command to ensure I get the right output without any hiccups. Let's see what the directory structure looks like!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Setting up the dev server**

I need to run the Vite project, which involves checking for the vite.config.js file. My first step is to install dependencies with npm install and then run the development server or build. I want to keep the user updated through this process. While starting the server seems straightforward, there are multiple steps involved. I might need to run these commands in the background to avoid blocking, especially since the dev server runs indefinitely. I'll decide on using npm ci or npm install based on the presence of package-lock.
**Running the development server**

I will start by running npm install, followed by npm run dev in the background to capture the local server URL. Vite provides the local server address, commonly on port 5173, but I want to double-check the vite.config.js for any custom settings. I’ll also look at the package.json for any "dev" scripts. I'll read both files in parallel for efficiency. After that, I'll proceed with the installation and server startup, keeping the user updated throughout the process.
**Tracking memory preferences**

I need to keep in mind that the user prefers responses in Korean, especially for descriptive text labeled "teacher_inquiry." I'll ensure to answer in Korean, avoiding white-colored text—though I can't control the text color. It's vital to provide status updates before running any tool calls. I plan to use multi_tool_use.parallel to read both files and then analyze the port and scripts afterward. Let's move forward efficiently!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Running the project**

I need to run the project for the user, specifically using "web." First, I'll install the necessary dependencies and start the dev server. I'll use a command to run it non-interactively and in the background, likely on port 5173 since that’s the default with Vite 6. I remember the user prefers auto-run tools and wants status updates. Since this is a straightforward task, I may skip the TODO list. I'll run the commands and ensure to print the URL. If the port is occupied, I'll select a new one.
**Setting up Vite project**

Vite automatically selects the next available port, but I can set it to 5173 if needed. Instead of manually opening a browser, I should ideally use the command `xdg-open` on Linux or `open` on Mac for the URL 'http://localhost:5173'. However, it's better not to open it unless necessary, as there may be permission issues. Following the steps, I'll run `npm install --no-audit --no-fund` to install dependencies, and then execute `npm run dev -- --host --port 5173`, ensuring the correct port is set.
**Managing Vite port conflicts**

If the specified port is already in use, Vite may prompt to choose a different one. I added earlier that I’ll assume the user isn’t available to interact, so I can pass flags to automate acceptance. However, instead of forcing `--strictPort`, it’s better not to set it, as Vite might just auto-increment the port anyway. I’ll run `npm install`, then `npm run dev -- --host`. Setting `is_background: true` will keep the server running. After starting, I can print the local URL, but without logs, it might be tricky to detect.
**Logging and compiling Vite project**

I could run the dev server in the foreground to capture the printed URL, but that would block other processes. Instead, I can run it in the background while logging to a file, like `.vite-dev.log`. The command `npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 > .vite-dev.log 2>&1 &` will direct output there. Tailing the log file will help confirm that the server started. I also see that placeholder files exist, but some are empty, which might lead to errors. For instance, `ElementLight.jsx` has 342 lines, but `ValuesSection.jsx` only has 21. Did we accidentally create duplicate files?
**Running the project setup**

It seems we previously created `index.js` but not `ValuesSection.jsx`, which might have existed already. That's okay; I’ll just proceed with the project. We have a `.gitignore` file, so next, I need to run `npm install` to get the dependencies and then start the dev server. I'll ensure to provide a quick update before running commands. Since the dev server relies on the installation, these tasks must be run sequentially. After installing, I'll run `npm run dev` in the background. I'll stick with npm as the package manager. Let's get started!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting npm issues**

I’m noticing a few issues with npm v10.8. The error in validate-engines seems separate from the dev server, which is running smoothly on port 5173. The confusion might stem from mixing up the error and server state. I should clarify that the server is accessible at http://localhost:5173. To fix, I recommend using either `npx vite`, `npm run dev`, or leveraging project-local npm within `node_modules`. If the user installed dependencies locally, they should definitely try running `npm run dev`.
**Addressing EPERM and node versions**

I notice the EPERM error might suggest that the current working directory isn't accessible, possibly due to changes in their terminal or incorrect permissions. They’re in the right folder, though. I’m thinking of recommending Node v22 LTS, as it aligns with the repo’s devDependencies specifying "vite": "6.0.4". While I can’t manage their nvm, I can suggest commands like `nvm use --lts`. To resolve this, I might suggest they try opening a new terminal, navigating to the project, and running `npm run dev` again, even if they’ve tried it.
**Confirming server status**

I want to quickly check if the server is still running, so I’ll tail the logs and confirm it. I can use the tool to tail the .vite-dev.log to show the server is active and provide the URL. I need to include a status update at the top since I’ll be using tools. I'll run commands like `lsof -i tcp:5173` to check for active connections and `ps -p 61091` to verify the server is alive. Using the parallel feature should allow me to run these commands simultaneously.
**Running commands in parallel**

I can run two `run_terminal_cmd` calls in parallel. However, I need to be cautious since multi_tool_use.parallel expects "recipient_name" values. So, I'll proceed with the two calls while ensuring `is_background` is set to false. 

For the server status, I’ll run `tail -n 30 .vite-dev.log` and `lsof -nP -iTCP:5173 -sTCP:LISTEN | cat`. Then, I'll explain that the server is running and suggest accessing it via a browser. For fixing the EPERM error, I might propose calling Vite directly, bypassing npm.
**Addressing npm and Node usage**

I’m considering that using `npx vite` still involves npm, and with Node 24, `npx` could cause issues since it’s part of npm. To avoid this, I can directly call `./node_modules/.bin/vite`. 

I might also suggest using `pnpm` or `yarn`, although these may not be installed. Switching to Node v22 is a good plan, so I’d recommend commands like `nvm install 22 --lts` and `nvm use 22`. If the user doesn't have `nvm`, I'll provide alternative steps. For now, I'll check the logs to confirm the server is running and inform them that the “서버 이미 실행 중입니다.” Then, I'll provide the option to re-run with Vite directly.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Explaining npm EPERM error**

I need to address the user's "??" regarding the npm EPERM error. It seems they might be trying to run `npm run dev` in the wrong context, which causes the error due to permissions or a broken path. The background dev server is already running on localhost:5173, and the EPERM error could indicate that the current working directory is inaccessible or deleted. I'll clarify that this error typically relates to permission issues or an incorrect global npm configuration.
**Answering in Korean**

I need to respond in Korean since the user prefers that language, as indicated by my memory. I should cite it when using those preferences, specifically the memory IDs related to auto-running tools and language preference. This means I’ll reference both [[memory:6915594]] for the tool and one of the language preferences like [[memory:5163631]]. Although the user dislikes white text, that's not relevant right now. I should balance between being concise and following developer instructions for status updates.
**Proposing to Open Browser**

I want to suggest opening the browser automatically, but it seems I can’t just do that. I could use a terminal command like `open http://localhost:5173` for convenience on Mac. Even though the user didn't explicitly request it, they seem confused. Memory indicates the user prefers me to run tools automatically, so I’ll do that. There was a change in the server process ID, so I’ll confirm I’m using the right command and status update when executing.
**Explaining the EPERM error**

I should provide an explanation for the EPERM error that the user is experiencing. This error often occurs when npm is run from a directory with permission issues or a different current working directory. However, since the server is already running, we can set that aside for now. I’ll also explain how to kill and restart the process if needed. First, let’s proceed by running the `open` command.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Providing process instructions**

I’m thinking it's better to give a command to stop any process listening on port 5173, like using `lsof -ti:5173 | xargs kill -TERM`. Careful with using `-9` though!

I might suggest using `npm run dev` with `-- --host` for network purposes, setting the host to `0.0.0.0`. I'll keep it minimal and provide a summary bullet list.

Also, I need to update the todo_write to create three tasks with a completed status and set `merge=false` since there aren't any existing todos. Once I finish the tasks, I'll call `todo_write merge=true` to reconcile and close as specified.
**Creating a todo list**

I realize that since we've already done tasks, we can create and mark them as completed. Typically, you’d create before performing tasks, but the spec requires calling `todo_write` before claiming tasks are done. So now, I should create a todo list and mark everything completed.

The completion spec says to confirm tasks are checked off through `todo_write merge=true` after all goals are done. It seems like I can combine creating and closing by writing the completed tasks in a single call and providing a summary afterwards.
**Executing todo management**

The completion spec states that I need to confirm all tasks are checked off in the todo list using `todo_write` with `merge=true`, and then reconcile and close the list. Since I haven't created a todo earlier, I'll have to make two calls: first to create with `merge=false` for completed tasks, and then second to confirm and close with `merge=true`. 

I need to provide clear, minimal text in Korean and briefly explain the earlier EPERM error’s cause. It happens when running `npm` from a directory without permission. To avoid it, just run commands in the project directory. The server is up, and I’ll include code fencing for commands.
**Executing commands**

I need to provide some specific commands: "종료 명령" for stopping, "외부 접속" for external access, and confirm "브라우저 열림" as done. 

Next, I’ll call `todo_write merge=false` with three completed tasks: "Install dependencies," "Start Vite dev server," and "Open in browser." After that, I’ll use `todo_write merge=true` with the same tasks.

For the final message, I’ll provide a status update about the server running at http://localhost:5173, explain the earlier error, and outline how to stop and restart with `--host`, along with the log location. I’ll avoid any irrelevant text formatting while executing `todo_write`.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing loading issue**

I need to figure out the "loading only" problem. The code seems to be heavily relying on Tailwind classes that reference CSS variables. The loading spinner might be slow due to external images, while the user sees only "로딩중," possibly from a Vite overlay. It could show a white screen, but the network might indicate something different. I also think there's something with the import paths for `HeroSection` in `ElementLight.jsx` that might need attention regarding extensions.
**Investigating loading display**

I'm examining why the page shows only "Loading...". Vite's resolver should correctly handle .jsx files, including the ones in the Values section that reference `ValuesSection.jsx` correctly. However, the browser is still just displaying that loading text. It could be due to React's StrictMode causing double rendering. I'm also considering that a large `tailwind.css` file, combined with absolute positioning of images and containers, might be causing issues with visibility. The body's height being set to 100% could be a factor too!
**Troubleshooting loading issues**

I'm puzzled about why "로딩중" is still showing instead of content. There are static sizes in place that should allow it to display, but it might be related to the font imports using CSS variables, which could be invalid. Also, the loading overlay might stem from a plugin, but I need to confirm. Checking the dev console for errors is tricky since the logs aren't capturing browser issues. I could run a curl command to fetch the HTML but can't view the actual content. I need to ensure that `createRoot` is set up correctly, and importing the CSS from `tailwind.css` seems fine.
**Exploring loading message**

I'm thinking about why only "로딩중만 뜸" is appearing. It could be that Vite's default `index.html` shows "Loading..." if there are module errors, but that seems unlikely. The `ElementLight.jsx` file is correctly structured and imported, so that shouldn’t be the issue. There might be an infinite network request due to heavy external images, but you should still see part of the layout. I wonder if the overlay showing "Loading..." is coming from the "vite-plugin-screen-graph"; I need to investigate that further.
**Investigating overlay causes**

I’m considering whether the plugin shows an overlay while analyzing, but it seems to only toggle in development mode. It might need a generated JSON file, and the logs indicate that's done. Alternatively, the "React dev overlay" could display "Loading..." during module preloading, but that doesn’t seem to fit the situation. I think I should check `tailwind.css` to see if any global fonts might be affecting the body and potentially causing the overlay to show.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Debugging loading spinner issue**

I need to focus on the loading spinner problem. The app shows "Loading..." and I’m wondering if it's due to font blocking. There's a static ElementLight, so why is it just rendering "loading"? I think maybe index.jsx isn't exporting correctly, but createRoot is used properly. The import path looks good, yet the logs show blank. It could be a runtime error causing a fallback. I'll check console errors too. Should I open devtools? Direct requests might be limited. Let's keep investigating server logs for clues!
**Investigating component imports**

In ElementLight.jsx, I'm checking the import from "./sections/HeroSection," which leads to index.js that exports the HeroSection component from "./HeroSection." The actual file is named HeroSection.jsx, but Vite supports importing without the extension. I need to confirm that there's indeed a default export like `export const HeroSection = () => {}`. 

Also, I see there’s a ValuesSection being imported similarly. So, why is it only showing "Loading"? The index.html includes 'tailwind.css,' which could be heavy, but I suspect the "Loading..." message may be due to something else, possibly the vite-plugin.
**Analyzing the white screen issue**

I’m considering that a blank white screen is often due to a 100% height body and the container width needing a large viewport, which might cause scrolling issues. There’s a huge fixed header, but content should still exist. I'll check if `ElementLight.jsx` uses the font CSS variables, as missing ones might lead to warnings without causing failures. 

Maybe there's a runtime error tied to Tailwind JIT with arbitrary values. The "Loading..." message could suggest we see Vite's spinner while HMR fails to connect, or it might be a React Suspense fallback from a dynamic import.
**Exploring the loading screen issue**

I’m thinking we didn't use Suspense, so perhaps the package.json's "source" field points to "./index.html," which might be contributing to the situation. The body only contains a minimal `<div id="app"></div>` and the heavy Tailwind CSS could be influencing the loading screen. 

But Vite's overlay typically shows error messages, not just "loading." I can't open the browser console programmatically, so I’ll check the .vite-dev.log for any compilation warnings instead. The fonts referencing in the code seem incorrect too, which might not block but could lead to 404 errors. 

Interestingly, the interface might be displaying something else labeled "Loading" from the "Anima Project." I’ll need to read the index.html for any direct mentions of "Loading...".
**Investigating blank screen causes**

The site might be blank because cross-origin images aren't loading, although the structure should still be visible. It seems our CSS sets the body height to 100%, and the main container has specific classes that might result in a white background without content. Most of the elements are absolutely positioned, which might push them out of the viewport, leaving only the white background visible. 

There’s an indication of "로딩중," suggesting a "Loading" overlay, possibly from a Vite plugin. The text might not show due to color blending with the white background. It could be helpful to fetch the HTML content via curl to see if "Loading..." is present.</details></think>

내부 상태를 확인 중입니다. 서버 HTML을 직접 받아서 "Loading" 문구 존재 여부와 번들 로딩 오류를 확인하겠습니다.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating loading issues**

I think the user is encountering an infinite loading spinner, which could be related to how modules are pre-bundled or a plugin screen-graph issue. I’m checking for any circular imports, but it seems it’s not that. I noticed the `ValuesSection` file is in the correct path and is re-exported properly through `index.js`. The structure looks good overall. Maybe the problem stems from a large component with background images affecting page visibility on mobile, where it could overflow.
**Analyzing loading spinner issue**

The user is just seeing a spinner. I realize the Vite dev server usually loads the page without issues, but a spinner might indicate that font loading is an issue, like with `Roboto Mono`. Alternatively, there could be a runtime error preventing React from rendering anything. I want to check the browser console logs but don’t have direct access. I can look at the Vite dev server logs or build to catch compile errors. I’ll fetch the dev-served HTML to check for any inserted module scripts or errors and ensure the server is running.
**Investigating blank page and spinner**

I’m trying to fetch `http://localhost:5173/src/index.jsx` to check if TypeScript is involved. The spinner typically indicates a loading issue in Chrome, where a blank white page may appear if the connection isn’t resolved. Earlier, the site opened automatically, so I wonder if mixed content is blocked, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. The blank body might be due to the styling of `#app` and the positioning of elements in `ElementLight`. If the viewport is smaller, only the white background might be visible, along with absolutely positioned elements beyond its view.
**Examining CSS and header visibility**

The hero section uses an image that's absolutely positioned, requiring scrolling to view. The header is supposed to be visible at the top but is defined lower down with fixed positioning. So, it should appear. I’m considering whether our font CSS variables, like `var(--www-toat-co-kr-semantic-heading-3-font-weight)`, could be undefined, leading to invalid values. This might cause issues, and while React typically handles CSS variables, it might be crashing due to a Tailwind configuration. I need to ensure Tailwind is processed correctly since it's included as a CSS file, not PostCSS.
**Reviewing Vite configuration and loading issues**

In the Vite config, I've set up the PostCSS plugin for Tailwind. Typically, I need a `tailwind.config.js` file with the content paths for generating used classes in HTML/JSX. While I linked `tailwind.css` directly in `index.html`, Vite should still process it. If Tailwind isn’t processed, the classes won’t exist, but the page should still display without styling. The indefinite loader might result from blocked Google Fonts. I’ll check by using curl to request the page again and also look for errors in the dev server logs. Let’s see what’s happening!</details></think>
