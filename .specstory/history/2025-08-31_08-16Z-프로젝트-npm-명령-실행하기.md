<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Running the dev server**

I'm planning to run `npm run dev`, and the dev server will use port 5173. Since this is a long-running command, I need to execute it in the background and provide status updates. After executing, I'll share the logs from the command, including a brief update. I should also mention that `http://localhost:5173` will be the link to access it. There's no need for a detailed todo list here since it's a straightforward task with just a couple of steps.
**Planning parallel tool calls**

I'm thinking we should read `package.json` and `vite.config.js` in parallel, and then run `npm run dev`. But first, I need to make sure dependencies are installed, so I'll run `npm ci` since the package-lock exists. For tools requiring interaction, I'll remember to pass non-interactive flags if needed, but it seems unnecessary here. My plan is to check the scripts, install, and then run the dev server. After that, I need to run it in the background efficiently.
**Considering the dev server setup**

I see that the guidelines mention using `| cat` for pagers, but since the dev server is a long-running process, I plan to run it in the background. There's a possibility that port 5173 might already be in use, but I guess we can just run it and check. It's noted that I should prefer running tools automatically, so I’m set to proceed with the plan. Let's move forward and see how it goes!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Executing commands for setup**

The system mentions some command syntax, but that's not relevant here. I should execute two commands: "npm install" followed by "npm run dev -- --host" which might help expose the address. For running the dev server, I need the background job flag as true. I can run multiple terminal commands sequentially since install must finish before dev. I should include status updates before and after each call and mention how to open the server in the browser, likely at http://localhost:5173.
**Checking Node compatibility**

I need to ensure that Node version is compatible with Vite 6, which requires Node 18 or higher. The machine probably has Node, but I can’t be sure. I could check by running 'node -v', but it’s not strictly necessary, just helpful for preflight. The instructions suggest running non-interactive commands. First, I’ll execute 'npm install' in the project directory after changing into /Users/parkcg/Downloads/figma-to-html, which should be the correct working directory since it initializes at the project root by default.
**Running commands safely**

To be extra careful, I’ll prefix my command with 'cd ... && npm install' to ensure I'm in the right directory. The tool advises that I should change to the correct directory if I'm in a new shell, so I'll use 'cd /Users/parkcg/Downloads/figma-to-html && npm install'. Next, I’ll run 'npm run dev'. To keep it non-interactive, I might consider adding '--open=false', but it’s not strictly necessary. I’ll capture the output of 'npm install' and handle any errors related to Node or permissions if they arise.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Testing local server status**

I’m considering running a quick check on the server status instead of using npx or web_search. I think I can execute a command like 'sleep 2; curl -sI localhost:5173' to verify if the server's up. I could also create a small loop to probe ports between 5173 and 5180.

I might run a command to print the first accessible port, and it could be important to check if Vite prints the local network link. I’ll also ensure the Node.js versions are okay.
**Preparing tool usage**

I need to ensure we have a status update included before each tool batch, which I've already done. Since the user prefers responses in Korean, I need to keep that in mind. I’ll use the 'teacher_inquiry' label for any descriptive Korean answers, but here I'm focused on direct action.

I know we’ve used various tools, so including small updates is essential. Now, let’s run the curl check. I might also want to show how to stop the server with 'npm run dev' if needed, but it’s not necessary to do that right now.
**Running port check command**

I’m planning to execute a command that will check specific ports to see if the server is responding correctly. The command looks like this: `bash -lc 'for p in 5173 5174 3000 8080; do if curl -sI "http://localhost:$p" | grep -i \"200\\|vite\" >/dev/null; then echo $p; break; fi; done || echo "NO"'`. 

I think it’s important to ensure that the output is clear and helpful for the user. Let's run this command now!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering Vite server options**

I'm looking at how Vite defaults to port 5173 but missed capturing the address because I piped the logs to avoid a pager. It's clear I need those logs to see the address. Long-running background commands should indeed be run with `is_background` set to true, which I did, but maybe I should tail the output? The tool interface doesn’t let me attach to previous jobs. I might have to start a new instance on a specified port, but that could lead to conflicts.
**Exploring Vite server options**

I could start the dev server again on port 5174 to prevent any conflicts and run it in the background with `npm run dev -- --port 5174 --host`. The Vite script is just "vite," and I can pass arguments after the double dash, which is great. After launching, I should provide the URL, and</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing responsive behavior**

I need to make the web page responsive so it can adjust dynamically to computer sizes. They want specific code changes for a Vite React setup with Tailwind. My first step will be checking the index.html for the viewport meta tag and looking at src/index.jsx for screen components. The request sounds generic but leads me to consider how to adjust container widths, typography, and ensure the root wrapper utilizes responsive CSS with Tailwind classes. I could also set responsive font sizes in a global CSS using Tailwind’s `@layer base`. I'll write down the multi-step tasks to tackle this!
**Planning responsive changes**

I see that I need to make some small but important updates: adding the viewport meta tag if it isn't already there, setting up global responsive typography using CSS clamp, and ensuring the root `div` has a min-h-screen and container with responsive max-width and padding. Before diving into coding, I should check several files like index.html, src/index.jsx, ElementLight.jsx, HeroSection.jsx, ValuesSection.jsx, and tailwind.css. I’ll read these files in parallel to streamline the process.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering responsive design**

I need to ensure the webpage is responsive by adjusting code to match different screen sizes. The current code has fixed widths, like w-[1920px], and absolute positioning. I'll add responsive Tailwind classes and wrap elements in a container with max-width settings. A simpler method might be implementing a "fluid scaling" wrapper that uses CSS transform scaling to fit the viewport width while adjusting height accordingly. I could also explore setting the base font-size using a calculation but fixed pixel classes limit flexibility.
**Implementing responsive scaling**

To effectively convert all widths and positions, I think the easiest route is to create a responsive "scale down to fit" wrapper. I'll wrap the content inside a div, setting its width to 1920px and applying a transform scale based on the viewport width. I'll also adjust the container's height for vertical scrolling.

I plan to implement a React hook that calculates the scale and applies both the transformation and height adjustments. Additionally, I'll add a resize event listener and ensure the meta viewport tag is present. Finally, I'll address the content's height, as it's currently too fixed with values like 6840px.
**Addressing container height**

The base container height is currently 1200, but there’s a lot of absolutely positioned content involved. This leads to an overall height that exceeds 1200. When using the scale wrapper approach, I plan to calculate the content's natural height by using a reference, setting the outer container height accordingly to maintain scrolling functionality.

In `ElementLight.jsx`, I'll wrap the inner content in a scaling container to apply the transformation. I’ll also add a `useEffect` with `useState` to compute the scale based on the window’s width, and maybe even consider height too.
**Scaling for responsiveness**

I typically plan to scale by width to ensure the content matches the viewport width, allowing for vertical scrolling. The design width is set at 1920, and I’ll use a reference to the content to determine the scroll height needed for the outer wrapper's height.

The outer wrapper will have a width of 100vw and a height based on the scaled height. I’ll also establish the transform origin at the top center and adjust the styles accordingly. Additionally, I’ll need to import `useRef` and `useEffect/useState` from React to manage this. Finally, I’ll create a todo list for implementing the code changes effectively.
**Planning implementation steps**

I realize we actually only have one file to work on, so I could skip the todo list, but it helps to track tasks. I’ll create a small todo list with two items: implementing the responsive scaling wrapper and testing on the dev server. 

Next, I’ll edit `ElementLight.jsx` to incorporate the wrapper. The code will include managing the scale based on viewport width, and I plan to avoid scaling up beyond the original design width of 1920 to prevent image blurring. I’ll ensure to use appropriate imports and maintain consistent indentation when making these changes. Finally, I’ll run a build to verify everything compiles correctly.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing responsive design**

I need to make the webpage responsive to different screen widths since the current setup is stuck at a fixed 1920px wide container with absolute positioning. The user asked for code to help dynamically adjust the layout for computer sizes. I should add a wrapper that scales based on viewport width, possibly using a React hook to adjust the scale according to `window.innerWidth` and handle any resizing events. I won’t output the actual code, though; I’ll edit the necessary files directly.
**Wrapping for scaling**

I see there’s already a top-level div with specific classes that can be adjusted. I’m thinking of wrapping the inner div for scaling with a few React hooks like `useEffect`, `useState`, and maybe `useMemo`. This could help compute scale either using CSS with something like `calc(100vw / 1920)` or by assigning a CSS variable through inline styles. However, I’m not entirely sure if using `calc()` directly within the `scale()` function is valid CSS. It's a bit confusing!
**Computing scale via JavaScript**

I’m thinking that using `calc()` in CSS for scaling might not work since it produces dimensioned values. Instead, I believe it’s better to compute the scale using JavaScript directly. I can create a small hook with a constant for the design width and some state for the scale. I’ll also set up a resize event to update this scale dynamically. In the JSX, I’ll wrap the content nicely, using the scale value for transformation, and figure out a dynamic way to handle the height.
**Adjusting for scaling**

I’ve realized that when scaling, the element's bounding box shrinks according to the scale factor. This means I need to adjust the wrapper's height to prevent overflow or ensure proper scrolling. A common solution is to use an extra container with a height based on the layout height multiplied by the scale. However, I’m concerned because our layout height is quite large, with the top-level element using absolute positioning that can reach around 7000px. This could complicate things a bit!
**Refactoring for scaling**

I need to make some adjustments since the current layout isn't working correctly with absolute positioning. The top container has a fixed height that doesn't accommodate the absolutely positioned children, causing them to overflow. To fix this, I’ll set up a wrapper with a calculated height that adapts based on scaling. I plan to create ref elements, manage height within a scaled context, and ensure no scroll issues arise. It’s essential to keep the code minimal, follow indentation styles, and carefully implement necessary updates while avoiding unnecessary restructuring.
**Implementing wrapper structure**

I need to set up the wrapper structure correctly around the scaled content in the `contentRef`. This involves creating a layout that centers the content properly while managing its scaling. I’ll define the `scaledHeight` based on changes in window size and ensure updates with a resize listener and a ResizeObserver to catch any content size changes dynamically. After editing the code, I’ll run the build command to check for any syntax errors and make sure to keep track of TODO statuses as I go. Let's move forward with this plan!</details></think>

I need to make sure the code compiles without issues. I added React imports and a transform scale wrapper. I also have to check for any semantic problems since I removed the outer container that had absolute positioned sections and replaced it with a wrapper affecting the layout. The inner structure has changed; now there's a new container and adjusted divs. I should double-check for any misplaced closure tags to ensure everything is syntactically correct.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering horizontal scrolling**

The user's request indicates they want horizontal scrolling to navigate left-right through content instead of scaling it to the viewport. I think we need to add the CSS property `overflow-x: auto` and possibly disable scaling on smaller screens. The phrase they used suggests this requirement clearly. 

To implement this, I might consider a container with `overflow-x: auto` and a fixed inner width of 1920 while keeping the scale at 1 to ensure horizontal scrolling is enabled.
**Adjusting scaling for scrolling**

I'm considering changing the scaling approach to allow scaling only when it’s greater than 1, but currently, we've set it to a minimum of `min(viewport/DESIGN_WIDTH, 1)`. This means that for a viewport smaller than 1920, scaling will fall below 1, eliminating horizontal scrolling. 

To enable horizontal scrolling, I can set the scale to 1 always and wrap the content in an overflow container. It seems like we need to satisfy both dynamic scaling and horizontal scrolling, aligning with user needs.
**Preparing for horizontal scrolling**

I need to add a wrapper styled with `overflowX: 'auto'` and a width of either `100vw` or `100%`. The outermost structure is a grid container, so I'll include a scroll container. 

Additionally, I plan to remove any scaling below 1 and set the next scale to 1. The user's request for horizontal scrolling suggests we should keep the scale at 1, which will let mobile devices remain at a width of 1920 and be horizontally scrollable. Lastly, the scroll container will have its height adjustment logic updated while keeping the original height intact.
**Setting container dimensions**

For the inner container, I’m thinking of keeping the width at `DESIGN_WIDTH` pixels. I plan to maintain the scale at 1 to preserve pixel-perfect design. Even though there was a previous request for dynamic scaling, the user now wants horizontal scrolling on smaller screens and centered content on larger ones. 

I’ll implement this by setting `nextScale` to 1. I can also consider adding an option to prefer scrolling, so if `preferScroll` is true, the scale remains at 1. That seems like a straightforward adjustment!
**Modifying ElementLight.jsx**

I’m looking to adjust `ElementLight.jsx` to improve the layout. First, I'll add a wrapper with `overflowX: 'auto'` inside the grid container, but I need to ensure the inner container has a minimum width of `DESIGN_WIDTH`. This setup will allow horizontal scrolling on smaller viewports while centering content on larger screens.

I plan to set the scale to 1, removing any scaling logic that would alter dimensions. The height reservation logic needs to stay intact to account for absolute positioning. Also, removing transformations will help maintain the fixed header, ensuring it stays correctly positioned. That seems essential for a smooth user experience!
**Updating layout adjustments**

I see that I need to remove the scale transform and scaling state while keeping the `contentRef` for height measurement. I’ll change the wrapper to have `overflowX: auto`, which should support horizontal scrolling. 

It seems like I don’t need to add `overflowY`, and I’ll leave the CSS adjustments for natural vertical scrolling as is. After I apply these code changes, I’ll test the dev server. I'll also create a new task in the todo list for enabling horizontal scrolling in the fixed-width layout, marking it as in progress. Finally, I’ll run the build to confirm everything compiles successfully.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Optimizing file reading and display**

Management suggests running tools in parallel when reading multiple files, but I'm only processing one for now. I should use `read_file`, then apply a patch to simplify the process. For better display, I can create a horizontal scroll by wrapping the `contentRef`. The outer wrapper should be `<div className="w-screen overflow-x-auto">`, while the inner track could be `<div className="min-w-[1920px] flex justify-center">`, ensuring the width matches 1920 pixels. This should allow proper horizontal scrolling without blank spaces.
**Adjusting scroller and layout**

I need to ensure that the scroller's width matches the viewport. If the viewport is less than 1920, it should allow scrolling; otherwise, it will fit without scrolling. Currently, the outer grid is set with `justify-items-center`, which could conflict with the scroller's alignment. I think it's better to simplify by having an `overflow-x-auto` container at the top level. 

So, I’d replace the previous structure with:

```html
<div className="bg-white w-screen overflow-x-auto" data-model-id=... >
  <div className="w-[1920px] mx-auto relative"> ...content... </div>
</div>
```

This way, content will center when the viewport is greater than or equal to 1920, but still allow overflow when it's smaller.
**Simplifying layout structure**

I've realized that using `mx-auto` on a 1920 width inside a smaller parent won't apply left and right margins properly due to overflow. In such cases, the content remains left-aligned, and the `margin: auto` doesn’t effectively center the inner content. To address this, I can remove the `grid justify-items-center` to prevent any centering conflicts.

I should simplify the structure by replacing the className with `bg-white w-screen overflow-x-auto` and removing unnecessary grid properties. Ultimately, I want to keep the changes minimal, focusing on making sure the top-level container effectively includes the `overflow-x-auto`. Now, it's time to fetch the file to patch things up!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Modifying for horizontal scroll**

I need to implement horizontal scrolling instead of scaling based on the user's request. They mentioned they want 좌우는 스크롤을 해야하는데? which translates to needing horizontal scroll. My previous update added scaling, but now I need to adjust that. I'll remove the scaling wrap and switch the container to overflow-x: auto, ensuring content width is at least 1920px. The absolute position elements should stay in a relatively positioned container for proper alignment. Let's make these adjustments!
**Implementing horizontal scroll**

For the horizontal scroll, I need to wrap the content in a container with `overflow-x-auto`, possibly using `w-screen` to match the viewport width. Inside, I’ll place a wide `div` set at 1920px. This setup allows for left-right scrolling if the viewport is narrower than that width. I should consider the fixed header; while it will stay anchored to the left, it may not scroll with the content. Changing the header to `sticky` or `absolute` might keep it aligned as the user scrolls horizontally.
**Addressing horizontal scrolling needs**

I’m considering that the user only requested horizontal scrolling, so I want to keep the header fixed for now. However, the fixed header set at 1920px might overflow the viewport, showing that it won't scroll with the content. This could lead to a disjointed appearance. A possible future improvement would be to change the header to `absolute` or maybe `sticky`, although getting horizontal stickiness right can be tricky. For now, I'll focus on removing the scaling logic and creating a horizontal scroll wrapper with the appropriate Tailwind CSS classes.
**Reviewing plugin and structure issues**

I’m unsure about the need for a plugin here, so I’m considering using standard classes like `overflow-x-auto` and possibly `overflow-y-hidden`, but we might want to keep vertical scrolling too since the content has large heights. The inner content will stay `w-[1920px] relative`.

I noticed some duplicate `</div>` tags causing structural issues after our recent edits. Specifically, there are mismatched closing tags between lines 225 to 230. I need to review this structure closely to ensure everything matches up correctly after inserting the wrappers. It looks like some nesting might be wonky.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating content scaling**

I'm considering the scaled content, which has elements with a width of 1940, and how transforms apply to the entire content, including its children. Luckily, these transforms won't cause overflow since they don't change the layout width. However, the content reference (contentRef) itself has a width of 1920, which could lead to overflow if the scale is set to 1 on smaller viewports. I set the scale to the minimum of the viewport width divided by 1920 or 1.
**Addressing overflow issues**

I'm thinking about how, on small viewports where the scale is less than 1, the width remains at 1920. This could lead to horizontal scroll since the outer container is at 100% width but still smaller than 1920. Even though transforms don't affect layout, they reduce the visual width, and we still see a scrollbar. To resolve this, I should wrap the content in a container with overflow hidden or adjust the display style. Using a wrapper styled to center content might help, too.
**Preventing horizontal scroll**

The user wants to match the width so there's no horizontal scroll, which I need to address. First, I should set the outer container to `width: 100vw` and `overflowX: hidden` to prevent scrolling. While using transform scaling works, it may not be fully sufficient if headers are fixed. I could simply set `html` and `body` to `overflow-x: hidden`, but since the user focused on fitting the width, we can adjust styles in `index.html` to ensure the scaling maintains the right content visibility.
**Exploring scaling methods**

I'm considering different methods to handle the scaling and layout. One option is to set the transform scale and keep the width at 1920 while also using `max-width: 100vw` and `overflow: hidden`. However, since contentRef remains at 1920, it doesn't help much. CSS zoom is inconsistent across browsers, so I'll stick with transform scaling. I can also wrap contentRef to have a dynamic width based on scale. The wrapper will keep its width equal to the viewport, preventing any scrolling issues.
**Refining layout and preventing overflow**

I'm examining our current code, which includes a wrapper `<div>` for contentRef. However, with the width set to 1920, this might cause overflow on smaller viewports since the wrapper is 100%. To resolve this, I plan to set the wrapper's CSS to `overflowX: hidden` and ensure it's centered. Additionally, we need to update ElementLight.jsx to recreate the wrapper structure with dynamic width based on scale. Also, I noticed some inconsistencies in our DOM structure with the footer and header placement; I should keep them inside the scaled container. Finally, I'll add global styles for overflow.
**Matching width and managing overflow**

The user wants to match the width instead of just hiding overflow, which I understand. While we scale down content to fit, it's crucial that no content gets clipped. To handle this, I plan to add the `w-screen overflow-x-hidden` class to the top-level container. This should help hide horizontal scroll issues, but I also want to ensure `body { overflow-x: hidden; }` is added to the index.html. I believe these changes will effectively manage overflow and improve the layout without any unwanted scrolling.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Calculating effective width**

I’m figuring out the effective base width we need to compute based on the scrollWidth of the actual content after it mounts. I’ll use DESIGN_WIDTH as an initial fallback, but if the content’s scrollWidth is greater, I’ll use that instead. To compute the scale, I’ll take the minimum between viewportWidth divided by contentRef.scrollWidth, or 1. The container's reserved width will be based on the current scaled width from DESIGN_WIDTH. To manage the initial measurement, I'll use ResizeObserver, though there may be a slight flicker initially, which should be fine.
**Adjusting the code**

I'm working on adjusting the code. First, I’ll decide whether to remove the DESIGN_WIDTH constant or keep it as a fallback. I’ll set a state for contentWidth initialized to DESIGN_WIDTH, which I'll update after mounting by reading contentRef.scrollWidth. In the function updateScaleAndHeight, I’ll calculate the width using contentRef?.scrollWidth or DESIGN_WIDTH, and the scale compared to window.innerWidth. I’ll also set the outer wrapper's reserved width accordingly. 

I’m considering how overflow hidden might cut off any content if the width is smaller but keeping the scaled width matching content width should prevent that. I need to confirm the correct transformOrigin—whether to use "top left" or "top center." If centering with auto margins works, I’ll go with that, but ensuring the header is positioned correctly is essential since it may escape the transform if the container scales.
**Understanding CSS behavior**

I'm analyzing how CSS transforms affect positioning. When I apply a transform to the parent, it creates a containing block, which means position: fixed elements inside will behave like they are absolutely positioned relative to that transformed ancestor. This means the header will be fixed to the scaled container rather than the viewport. 

Now, the footer’s using absolute positioning with widths of 1920 and 1940. Since the container has a width of 1920px, I'm wondering if contentRef might only be 1920 wide, but there are absolute items that could extend beyond that. I suspect the scrollWidth of contentRef will reflect the maximum scrollable width, likely including overflow from those absolutely positioned children. However, I need to check if it counts overflow correctly when those elements remain visibly outside their container.
**Measuring content dimensions**

I want to ensure I capture the entire area, so I’m considering measuring the maximum of DESIGN_WIDTH and known element widths. A simpler approach could be to set contentRef to a larger wrapper element that includes all content, even those positioned absolutely, although that might not account for overflow. 

Alternatively, I could compute the bounding box width using getBoundingClientRect() before any transformations. However, since transforms scale the measurements, I need to be careful. Although I can temporarily set the scale to 1, that feels messy. Instead, I think defining a child wrapper called 'innerContainer' with an explicit width of max(1920px, contentRef.scrollWidth, and measured widths) could be a more straightforward solution.
**Computing intrinsic width and scaling**

I’m thinking of another approach to manage the widths in my layout. If the container's overflow is set to visible, I could scale elements larger than 1920 down to fit, ensuring no horizontal scroll appears. I’ll effectively compute the required content width as the maximum of DESIGN_WIDTH, current scrollWidth, and known oversize values like 1940. 

I can programmatically query child nodes to find the maximum rightmost offset using getBoundingClientRect. To keep it simpler, setting the container width to 1920 plus an overscan margin could help accommodate overflowing elements. Notably, I’ll use a child wrapper with a width of max(1920px and contentRef.scrollWidth) to simplify overflow management, employing getBoundingClientRect for accurate measurements by temporarily adjusting the transform. 

I’ll refine my implementation by establishing a measureIntrinsicSize function, ensuring no flicker occurs, possibly by making the element invisible while toggling styles. I'll use state variables to track intrinsic dimensions and respond to layout changes dynamically. I’ll implement this, focusing on maintaining readability and performance while ensuring component responsiveness. Then, I’ll adjust the scale accordingly during resize events, guarding against unnecessary re-renders and infinite loops. Finally, I’ll apply the code edits, ensuring to run lints and maintain formatting conventions, then mention any fixes made during the process.
**Implementing the patch**

I’m preparing to patch the code to add an `intrinsicWidth` state, starting with the initial `DESIGN_WIDTH`. I'll modify the `updateScaleAndHeight` function to calculate `unscaledWidth` and `unscaledHeight` based on the element’s bounding rectangle. 

Instead of relying on the closure scale, which could get stale due to the empty dependencies, I’ll temporarily set `style.transform` to 'none' when measuring to avoid issues. After keeping the previous transform, I’ll measure and restore the original style immediately, ensuring minimal visual disruption. Then, I’ll compute `nextScale` and adjust the wrapper width accordingly, based on the new `intrinsicWidth`. It’s time to implement these changes!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Revising footer placement**

I realized that we closed all the wrappers before starting the footer outside of the main wrapper. That’s not right, as it puts the footer outside the scaled container. I need to remember that the content, including "header" and "footer," was originally inside the larger wrapper. It's important to keep everything organized correctly within the intended structure!
**Evaluating DOM structure issues**

I think our recent edits broke the DOM structure by placing the footer and header outside, which makes their absolute positions not relate to the scaled container properly. The "header" is fixed, but the main content might have vanished because scaledHeight is computed smaller than it should be. This could be due to absolute positioning leading to a getBoundingClientRect height of zero. The inner container lacks an explicit height, and since we have many absolute elements, that messes things up. It looks like almost everything has an absolute position!
**Analyzing height measurement issues**

I’ve realized that measuring the height using getBoundingClientRect on "bg-white relative" with only absolute children results in a height of 0. This makes scaledHeight become 0, meaning the wrapper height is also 0. So, it doesn’t show up due to overflow hidden. The scaled content might not be visible either. To fix this, instead of using measuredHeight, I could compute scaledHeight by measuring the outer content's scrollHeight. However, measuring absolute children could still return 0. Maybe I should determine the maximum bottom edge among the children instead!
**Revising height and overflow strategies**

An alternative approach is to avoid any height restrictions by removing overflow hidden and letting the transformed content overflow. I could set the wrapper's minHeight to match the scaled bounding box calculated from the outer wrapper's bounding rectangle. If the content uses absolute positions, we could find the maximum bottom by iterating through child nodes, but that’s tricky in React. Instead, computing from contentRef’s offsetHeight might help, although it typically ignores absolutely positioned children. A cleaner fix could be using a CSS transform for scaling and adjusting the width based on the design width and scale, but I also think I could simply compute "scaledHeight" from the earlier set height in computed style.
**Addressing height and overflow issues**

I’ve noticed the inner "bg-white w-[1920px] relative" doesn’t have height because we previously removed the "h-[1200px]" on the container. This likely caused a zero height, collapsing the screen. I should restore that height or compute it based on the bottommost element. Instead of scaling the entire page, it might be better to adjust the CSS to use responsive widths. 

I think removing overflow hidden and letting content overflow vertically will solve the disappearing content issue. The new wrapper structure should not set fixed height or overflow settings, allowing the content to be visible and scrollable. I’ll ensure we close wrappers properly, with header and footer correctly placed inside the content area.
**Fixing footer and header placement**

It looks like we placed the footer outside the "relative" container, which causes it to anchor to the viewport, making it potentially invisible or overlapped. Originally, the header and footer were siblings within the relative wrapper, but our recent changes moved them outside. We should move them back inside the inner "bg-white w-[1920px] relative" container.

To fix this, I need to restructure the code, removing incorrect closing tags and ensuring both the header and footer are included in the inner container. I'll also eliminate height and overflow hidden from the wrapper to help clarify content visibility. Let's implement those changes and make sure everything lines up correctly!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting content visibility**

I need to address why content isn’t visible. We introduced a scaling wrapper with a transform, but it seems like the scaled container height isn’t reserved because we removed the parent height. The original code was filled with absolutely positioned elements in the 1920 canvas, and now my new setup might lead to overflowing content. Since the outer div has overflow-x hidden, it may cause vertical cropping. Without a height set, the wrapper div could collapse to zero height if the scaled element is using absolute positioning.
**Examining container height issues**

The inner top-level div with the class "bg-white w-[1920px] relative" has absolutely positioned children, which makes its height not expand normally. This could mean the content reference's scrollHeight is likely zero. In the past, we measured height to set scaledHeight, but now we've removed a height, possibly resulting in the container having no intrinsic height. The parent wrapper might not display because of zero height, but transforms can still render. However, if the container isn’t tall enough, the children may not appear as expected.
**Analyzing measurement methods**

It seems we might be using getBoundingClientRect after temporarily removing the transform. For a relative container with absolutely positioned children, its height is determined either by an explicitly set height or the actual content. If there's no inherent height, the bounding client rect could be zero. In the original code, the div had a height of 1200px, which we removed in the first edit. Now, the container likely has zero height since the absolutely positioned children aren't counted.
**Resolving visibility issues**

It looks like the content may not appear because the element has a height of zero. Absolutely positioned children can still be visible, but within the transform scale wrapper, cropping might occur due to the wrapper not reserving height. Since the wrapper width is set but height isn't, nothing could display. To resolve this, I think the best solution is to restore an explicit height for the canvas or compute it based on the tallest absolutely positioned child. Alternatively, I could use a minimum height value to ensure it covers all content.
**Planning canvas size adjustments**

I think I can set the canvas container to have a minimum height of 7500px based on the footer’s position. If we use a relative container and add a tall spacer, we can ensure visibility. Since the height is zero, the scaledHeight was also zero, which has contributed to the visibility issue. 

We could estimate a constant height of around 7200px to accommodate all content and avoid disappearing elements. Using `Math.max` for width calculations will also help account for absolute children, ensuring nothing gets cut off. I'll implement these adjustments carefully!
**Implementing layout adjustments**

I’m planning to set measuredWidth to the maximum of `node.scrollWidth` and `rect.width`, which might capture the desired 1940 value.

I’ll also adjust the `transformOrigin` to "top left" to align the scaling properly and prevent cropping. The outer container should not have overflow-x hidden since they want to avoid horizontal scrolling; we can keep it as is.

To ensure height is reserved, I’ll reintroduce a scaledHeight based on the constant CANVAS_HEIGHT of 7200. I’ll implement these changes in state management and the update effect, while also maintaining the width and height properties for inner content. Let's write the patch!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing container height issue**

I'm figuring out that the container's height is zero unless there's an explicit height defined. In the original code, there was 'h-[1200px]' on the inner div, but we changed it by removing the fixed height. This collapse to zero means the content isn't visible. The solution seems to be reserving a height of around 7000px for the wrapper. I’ll set the wrapper height style to include the scaledHeight, allowing proper scrolling.
**Ensuring proper layout settings**

I'm making sure to keep the 'DESIGN_WIDTH' and 'intrinsicWidth' in mind. I need to set the header to be fixed while also verifying that the closing tags are in the correct order. In the wrapper, I’ll set up a div to reserve space with adjusted widths and heights based on the intrinsicWidth and scaling. The content height must be at least the CANVAS_HEIGHT to avoid clipping. It’s interesting that the outer wrapper will set the height, which helps maintain the layout!
**Implementing height adjustments**

I'm planning to reintroduce height with scaledHeight in the patch. We'll keep the overflow-x hidden and apply the patch. I should propose to automatically run the dev server and suggest the user refresh the page, but I don’t want to overload them. I’ll make sure to confirm everything is properly indented for the React file and adjust the style object accordingly. After applying the patch, I’ll run read_lints and ensure everything is compiled. If needed, I can run the build command to be safe!
**Including status updates**

I realize we need to add status updates before making any tool calls; I think we may have missed that before. Previously, we used the "방금 ..." style, but now we should include a brief update before invoking any tools. It seems like a good change to make! I’ll go ahead and apply the patch to ensure those updates are consistently included moving forward. This should help keep everything clear and organized.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing layout issues**

I need to address the problem with the right edge being cut off. Currently, I'm using measuredWidth from getBoundingClientRect, adjusting the intrinsicWidth based on the scale. The wrapper's width is set accordingly, but I think the content's absolute positioning might be contributing to the issue. There are elements set with specific widths and positions that could cause a wider layout than expected. It looks like I need to reevaluate how I'm measuring dimensions and handling scaling.
**Analyzing positioning issues**

I see that the children elements are absolutely positioned with negative left values, which could complicate how getBoundingClientRect calculates the overall width. I need to ensure that the measuredWidth takes into account both scrollWidth and the dimensions derived from the rect. If intrinsicWidth equals scrollWidth, yet we're applying a scale, the transformOrigin being set to the top center might be causing the cutting-off issue. The wrapper width may be smaller than the visual width due to subpixel rounding or overflow from elements with negative offsets.
**Adjusting overflow settings**

I've realized that we previously set the wrapper's overflow to not be hidden, yet the root div still has overflow-x-hidden, which hides any overflow on the right from transformation. To ensure everything fits without horizontal scrolling, we might need to shrink the scale so the content width fits the viewport fully. However, cutting is still an issue since the wrapper uses overflow hidden. Easiest fix? Removing overflow-x-hidden could introduce a slight horizontal scroll. I’ll consider adjusting the CSS to set the wrapper width fully without cropping.
**Adjusting transform origin and overflow**

I've realized that setting transformOrigin to top left instead of top center could prevent the right edge from getting clipped due to slight differences in centering. If the origin is top left and the wrapper width matches ceil(intrinsicWidth * scale), there shouldn't be clipping. 

Modifying the root's overflow to overflow-x-visible could also help, since we want to avoid horizontal scroll. If the scale keeps the width within the viewport, we might adjust for rounding by using nextScale or applying maxWidth: 100vw to the wrapper to ensure no overflow.
**Resolving clipping issues**

I need to investigate elements with widths exceeding 1920 px, considering our measuredWidth uses node.scrollWidth while contentRef's width is set to intrinsicWidth. We set transform to none for measurements, and the header being fixed could be causing issues as it behaves relative to the viewport, not the scaled container.

To avoid clipping, I’ll adjust the transformOrigin to top left, set the wrapper width appropriately, remove overflow-x-hidden, and ensure the scaled width fits within the viewport. Centering can be done using flexbox, allowing the wrapped content to fit properly without margin issues.
**Implementing design adjustments**

Currently, the top-level wrapper has a width of 100%, leading to left alignment instead of center, which might be okay to avoid cropping. However, I'll ensure there's no margin set on contentRef since the parent flex container will handle centering. 

I'll make some updates: remove overflow-x-hidden from the root, set the outer container to display flex with justifyContent center, and adjust the nextScale calculation. Also, I’ll include status updates for tool calls and manage any TODOs if needed. Let’s apply the patch with these modifications!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning AWS Amplify Deployment**

I need to initialize a Git repository and deploy using AWS Amplify, focusing on the user’s macOS setup. First, I should run `git init` and check for the `.gitignore` file. Once confirmed, I’ll set the default branch to main and commit the initial code. Then, I can set up AWS Amplify hosting. The user likely prefers the Amplify CLI flow, which means I'll run commands like `amplify init` and `amplify hosting add`. I also need to ensure AWS Amplify CLI is installed, so I'll check the version using a command in the terminal.
**Evaluating AWS Amplify CLI Installation**

I might not have the AWS Amplify CLI installed, so I need to check if I can use `npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli` or the newer version via `npm create amplify@latest`. Amplify’s Gen 2 recently switched to just 'amplify' instead of '@aws-amplify/cli'. If I try `amplify -v` and it’s not installed, I’ll install it. However, it requires AWS credentials and assumes the user won't interact, so I’ll need to pass non-interactive flags. I'm unsure if the user has AWS configured on their local machine.
**Checking AWS CLI and Credentials**

I need to verify if the AWS CLI is installed and if the credentials are set. I can run `aws configure list` and also `aws sts get-caller-identity` to check for valid credentials. If those commands aren't available or return an error, I’ll need to guide the user on providing their credentials. Alternatively, I could suggest using Amplify Hosting through `amplify publish`, but since the user specifically asked for Amplify, I should focus on that while also proposing GitHub initialization for an easier path.
**Creating a TODO list for deployment**

I need to make a TODO list since there are multiple steps involved and ensure I provide status updates per the developer spec. I'll write it concisely. 

First, I’ll include items like initializing the Git repo, creating the first commit, checking and setting up the Amplify CLI, initializing the Amplify project, adding hosting, and finally building and publishing. 

Then, I’ll run the necessary Git commands and check if Amplify is installed. I also need to verify AWS credentials; if they're missing, I’ll guide the user to provide them or consider a GitHub connection.
**Planning AWS Amplify Initialization**

I see that we want to automatically run tools, but I can’t proceed without the necessary credentials. We need to detect those first. It’s also important to note that running `amplify init` in headless mode requires specifying app information. For static hosting, I might consider using `npx amplify-hosting@latest configure`. 

I’ll implement the steps until we hit the credentials block. Parallel tool calls can be executed after completing the Git initialization and commit. Finally, I'll start with a status update before running the terminal commands. Let's move forward!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Configuring Amplify Setup**

I realize we need to add a status update before making tool calls; I've done that in previous messages. We’ve installed the Amplify CLI, so the next step involves creating an Amplify configuration with environment variables if the user can provide them. Alternatively, we could use Git-based deployment via Amplify Console, which would need manual OAuth. Another option is to set up AWS Amplify Hosting using command line tools, but that requires AWS credentials to be configured. Let's check for environmental variables next!
**Checking SPA Build Requirements**

I need to confirm if there are any requirements for the SPA build artifact location, since the Amplify CLI can auto-detect frameworks. For Vite, the build output is typically 'dist'. In the Amplify Hosting setup with 'amplify add hosting', we'll set the distribution directory to ‘dist’ and run build commands. 

Next, I should check the environment for AWS credentials. If they’re not present, I can suggest two options to the user: either continue with GitHub Amplify Hosting or provide AWS credentials. I note that the user prefers tools to run automatically.
**Addressing Credential Requirements**

I realize we need AWS credentials to proceed, but `aws configure` requires user interaction, which isn't feasible since I can't assume the user is available. Instead, I should ask for the credentials or suggest they run 'amplify configure' in a terminal themselves.

Since they've asked to deploy, I can prepare the necessary Amplify files by running `amplify init --yes` with parameters. The new Amplify CLI v14 supports headless configuration, but without AWS credentials, the process will fail. I’ll also need to create an amplify directory with specific JSON parameters.
**Requesting AWS Credentials**

I need to set the environment variables for AWS by using the `--providers` option with `accessKeyId`, `secretAccessKey`, and `region`. I remember that older versions allowed me to specify these, but I’m not sure about v14. Since we don’t have the credentials, I should pause and ask the user for them. It’s important to communicate that we’re blocked due to missing secrets. I’ll provide steps on obtaining AWS credentials and suggest using Amplify's GitHub connected hosting as an alternative. Also, I need to respond in Korean for the user!
**Providing Status Update and Next Steps**

I need to give a concise status update, mentioning that we've initialized Git and installed the Amplify CLI. However, we're currently blocked due to missing AWS credentials. I can suggest next steps, like preparing Amplify configuration files and running `npm run build` again, although that isn't strictly necessary. 

Since the user prefers answers in Korean, I'll aim for that. I should request their AWS credentials or suggest proceeding with GitHub-based deployment. I’ll also ask for the region, defaulting to 'ap-northeast-2', and keep verbosity minimal. Finally, I’ll update the statuses for tasks and check for AWS environment variables before concluding.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning Amplify deployment**

I need to focus on proceeding with the Amplify deployment since the user wants to do "git init and deploy with Amplify." We've already initiated the git repository and made the first commit. Now, I realize Amplify requires AWS credentials, and there aren't any set up. I could prompt the user to run `amplify configure`, but it's interactive. Instead, I might suggest alternatives like asking for AWS access keys or using Git-based Web hosting with GitHub, since the CLI requires credentials. It feels a bit tricky without `awscli` installed!
**Assessing Amplify credentials**

It seems we're at a standstill because we can't get the necessary AWS credentials. While we could install the AWS CLI and ask for keys, I prefer not to request them directly unless absolutely necessary. Given the constraints, I think I should ask the user for access keys, the region, and the profile name while keeping it brief. 

Before making any tool calls, I should note that the Amplify init is blocked due to missing credentials and propose confirming with the user about pushing to GitHub since it wasn't explicitly requested.
**Clarifying user preferences**

I need to make sure I'm addressing the user's preferences for responses, which should be in Korean only, and label any difficult descriptive text responses with 'teacher_inquiry.' This particular response isn't long or descriptive, so I can just reply in Korean without any issues. 

Since there are no tool calls right now, I'll just give a status update. I'll propose the exact commands the user can use to set AWS credentials non-interactively if they provide keys, such as using `mkdir` for the `.aws` directory and echoing the configuration. Let's keep it simple!
**Exploring AWS CLI options**

I can install the AWS CLI, either through brew or pip, but since I need to assume a non-interactive setup, using `brew install awscli` might not be feasible if brew isn't available. Instead, I could set up the `.aws/credentials` and config files, which the Amplify CLI can use. For this, I'll need to ask the user for specifics, including the AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region, and profile name. 

Once I have those details, I can create the necessary files and run the `amplify init --yes` command with the appropriate project configuration for Vite React and utilize the headless parameters. Then, we can add hosting afterward!
**Planning Amplify Hosting steps**

For setting up Amplify Hosting, the current CLI command is `amplify add hosting`, choosing between "manual" or "continuous." In Amplify v14, I can go with "Hosting with Amplify Console (Managed hosting)" for manual deploys. 

However, I need the user’s AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and preferred region to proceed. My plan is to ask for these keys and the hosting type, either Amplify Console or S3 and CloudFront. I’ll also provide status updates and the necessary commands to create AWS credentials files once I have the information. Let's keep it concise and straightforward in Korean!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Preparing git commands in Korean**

I see that the user prefers responses in Korean. They've asked me to stage changes in git, likely meaning they want to add everything and commit those changes. There might already be a initialized repo with one prior commit. I'm wondering if we've already committed those responsive changes we made to ElementLight, as there were several edits after the initial commit. It seems best to use git add -A and commit with a message that highlights the responsive scaling and fixes.
**Planning git actions**

The user might want to push changes to a remote repository for their deployment app, possibly linking it to GitHub. They didn’t specify a remote, so I’ll start by checking the git status with the command `git status --porcelain`. Then, I'll use `git add -A` and commit with a clear message. Since this task is straightforward, I believe I can skip creating a todo for it, even though it seems a little overkill. I'll keep everything concise!
**Executing git process**

First, I'll check the status to see if there are any changes before making a commit. If there are, I plan to stage everything with `git add -A` and then commit with an appropriate message, letting the user know that a commit has been created. I should remember that the `.screen-graph.json` might change as it’s generated. I’ll run the status command first, followed by adding and committing only if changes exist. Let's get this done!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating repository options**

I should ask for the repository URL or suggest creating a new repo named "figma-to-html." If the repo doesn't exist, GitHub will reject the push unless I use a specific command to set up upstream. It might be better to propose adding the remote origin to `https://github.com/Park-CG/figma-to-html.git` and then push. If they confirm they’ve created the repo, we can push successfully after that.
**Setting up remote for deployment**

They've asked to create a deploy app on Amplify and will handle it from there. First, I’ll set the remote. I can ask for the desired repository name, defaulting to "figma-to-html." I'll set that up and attempt to push; if it fails, I can inform them to create the repo and push again. They want cites for any web search results, so I’ll mention the provided profile link. Now, I’ll create a new to-do for adding the remote and pushing. Let’s execute those terminal commands!
**Configuring remote and pushing**

First, I need to set the remote origin if it doesn't exist, or update the URL if it does. They mentioned creating a deploy app, not the repository, so they likely want me to push. I'll try to push, but if I get a “Repository not found” error, I’ll let them know to create the repo under their profile and then try again. I'll add a new "in-progress" to-do, check the current remotes, and set the remote to the desired URL if necessary before attempting to push.
**Adding remote without pushing**

It seems better to avoid attempting a push since it's not available right now. The user mentioned they would create the deploy app after I handle the git add. Since they provided a link, they might just want me to add the remote. I think they plan to create the repository on GitHub and then push to it later. So, I’ll proceed to add the remote without pushing by first checking if it exists before running the command.
**Updating repository status**

First, I’ll set the remote origin to the user's GitHub repository under the name "figma-to-html." I’ll run `git remote -v` to check the current settings. If nothing is listed, I’ll proceed to add the remote with the command `git remote add origin https://github.com/Park-CG/figma-to-html.git`. I'll instruct the user to run `git push -u origin main` once they create the repo, or I can do it if they confirm. Let's execute these commands and keep everything organized with brief status updates!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Running git push**

I need to run git push, making sure the remote is set. I'll execute 'git push -u origin main', which might need credentials. On a Mac, it usually prompts for those, but I should assume interactive prompts aren’t available and use non-interactive flags instead. I can’t supply tokens, so I’ll push and capture the output if it fails. Then, I can suggest the user log in or set a personal access token. Also, I need to keep styling in mind for outputs.
**Tracking push status**

I also need to maintain status updates since the developer spec requires them before tool calls. For this, I should create a todo item like "Push to origin." Even though it feels like only a single step, it’s part of a broader task, especially since our previous todo list focused on deployment tasks. I’ll add “Push main to origin” as in_progress before executing the push command. If it fails, I’ll mark it as pending, and if it succeeds, I’ll mark it complete. Let’s get started!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving repository issues**

It looks like we're dealing with a push error due to the repository not being found. This could be because it doesn't exist yet on the user’s account or there’s an authentication issue. The user mentioned they’d create the deploy app but is now asking to push. I should check if the remote repository URL is correct and suggest they create a repo on GitHub or consider installing GitHub CLI to handle it automatically.
**Addressing repository creation**

The error indicates that the repository hasn’t been created yet. We could check if using SSH might work better, and I can suggest the user create the repo or adjust the URL if they set it up under a different organization. Since they like responses in Korean and prefer minimal prompts, I should provide a status update first. If they can, they should create the repo or supply a token so we can try to create it via the GitHub API.
**Managing repository and push tasks**

Since the personal access token (PAT) isn’t present, I’ll ask the user to create the repository or provide the token. We could create a repo named "figma-to-html" with GitHub CLI if it were installed, but it's not. Installing it would involve authentication steps, so I should suggest the user create the repo and then reattempt the push. I need to update the task status, possibly marking it as blocked, and provide a clear update about the push failure due to the repo not being found.
**Guiding repository creation**

Next, I’ll ask the user to create the repo and confirm. I could propose creating the GitHub repo with the command, but it requires authentication with GitHub CLI. Since they previously indicated they would create the deploy app, they should create the 'figma-to-html' repository on their account. I’ll provide a link for them to do this easily. My response needs to be concise, so I'll suggest some fallback steps in Korean and remind them to retry the push once the repository is created.
**Updating user on repository creation**

We can't push until the user creates the repository. I should ask if they want a different repository name and clarify that no code changes are needed yet. After they create it, we'll attempt the push again. I plan to provide a concise answer in Korean, including bullet points and a next-step command. I’ll also suggest that they can automatically create the repo using a PAT if they provide the token. Meanwhile, I need to update the status since the previous push attempt failed due to the missing remote repository.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering GitHub app configuration**

I'm thinking about how to configure the AWS Amplify app on GitHub. First, I need to go to Settings in GitHub, then Applications, and find the AWS Amplify settings. From there, I can choose access for "All repositories" or specifically for `figma-to-html`. If the repo is private, I'll have to ensure proper access.

Alternatively, I could use manual deploy options or the Amplify CLI to create hosting, but they prefer to maintain it through the Amplify console. It seems organization approval is necessary too, so I should check that as well.
**Exploring deployment options**

I'm considering offering a way to switch to "Deploy without Git provider," using either the Amplify Hosting drag-and-drop feature or the Amplify CLI publish option. Since they mentioned the "repo not showing," I should provide steps to reconfigure GitHub App permissions.

I can run `git remote get-url origin` to confirm the URL, but that might not be essential. Although the tool suggests citing search results, I think including the user's GitHub profile link could be extra, but I'll keep it minimal. I'll also ensure to include a status update if there are tool calls.
**Providing steps for repository access**

Since I won't be making any tool calls, I can provide clear steps to follow instead. I’ll keep it concise in a bullet list format. The user prefers responses in Korean, so I'll keep that in mind as well. Here’s a minimal checklist:

- In the Amplify console, go to "Connect app," select the GitHub provider, and click "Manage repository access" (or use the "Configure" link). Reinstall the "AWS Amplify" GitHub App to allow access to all repositories or specifically `figma-to-html`. The steps are: GitHub → Settings → Applications → Installed GitHub Apps → AWS Amplify → Configure → Select repositories → Save.

- If it’s an organization repo, the org admin needs to approve the App.

- Ensure the repo is under the `Park-CG` account, and confirm that the main branch exists and is not empty.
**Verifying branch and deployment options**

I need to provide commands to verify the branch, which we already know how to do. If the repo still isn’t showing, the user should refresh the repo list, toggle off "Show only my repos," and check the search field.

As an immediate workaround, they can use the "Manual deploy (Drag and drop)" option or go with the "Amplify CLI" method, which involves commands like `amplify init`, `amplify add hosting`, and `amplify publish`. But they'll need AWS credentials for this. Since the user mentioned creating the app, I can suggest proceeding with manual deployment using archives. They can run `npm run build` to create the `dist/` folder, zip it, and then upload that folder. While I should provide the commands for zipping, I want to keep it minimal and avoid detailed instructions. The commands for macOS would be:

- `npm run build`
- `cd dist && zip -r ../dist.zip . && cd -`  

However, I remember that the Amplify drag-and-drop accepts folders, specifically the `dist` folder. They did express that they want to see the repository on the page rather than resorting to alternatives, so I should keep that focus.
**Outlining steps to reconnect Amplify**

Here’s a concise list of steps to reconnect the Amplify app to the GitHub repository:

1) In the Amplify console, navigate to Hosting > Connect app > GitHub, and click the "Configure" link. Reauthorize the app, select "All Repositories" or just `figma-to-html`, and save it. Then, refresh the Amplify console.

2) If you initially connected with limited access, you'll need to remove and re-add the app in GitHub by going to Settings → Applications → Authorized OAuth Apps or Installed GitHub Apps.

3) Check the repository visibility. If it's private, ensure Amplify has permissions for private repositories; otherwise, make it public.

4) If the repository still isn't appearing, disconnect GitHub from Amplify by going to AWS Console Amplify > Account settings > Source provider > Disconnect GitHub, then connect again.

I suggest trying these steps and then confirming if it worked!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Configuring app connection**

I’m looking at connecting an app using Amplify Console. First, I need to authorize the GitHub app and set the repository access. I’ll select the main branch for the repository. For build settings, I can stick with the Amazon Linux 2023 image and Vite framework. The build command should be npm ci, thanks to the package-lock. Setting Node version to 20.x is good as Vite 6 needs it. Finally, I’ll manage the rewrite rules for the SPA's 200 fallback to index.html.
**Setting up SPA redirect and hosting**

I’m adding a redirect for the SPA: Source: /<*> to Destination: /index.html with a 200 status. Static assets should keep working, and I might want to add a 404 rule too; Amplify probably manages that. For pull request previews, it’s optional, but I can attach a custom domain. If the repository isn't listed, I'll instruct the user to adjust the GitHub App settings. 

I'll include CLI commands for headless hosting as well, just in case. Finally, I’ll provide a sample amplify.yml for customization along with the necessary region settings.
**Structuring the information**

I’m considering whether to mention memory; it’s probably not strictly necessary, but I’ll include a note for memory citation. I plan to present the steps using markdown headings and bullet points, keeping it concise but still comprehensive. There’s a mention of including a link to GitHub profile search results, but I’ll skip that since it’s not really needed. 

I’ll also pass on citing any links, as the AWS Amplify docs weren't fetched, and the previous tasks aren't fully updated, but since this is just informational, I don't need to worry about that.
**Outlining the setup steps**

Alright, let’s outline the necessary steps for the setup process. First, I’ll choose the appropriate region. Then, I’ll connect GitHub and grant the necessary access. After that, I’ll specify the repository and branch. Next up is selecting the build image and runtime, along with configuring the build settings via an amplify.yml file. 

I need to include build commands, the output directory, and set up any rewrite or redirect rules for the SPA. I'll note the optional environment variables, auto builds on commits, and pull request previews. Finally, I’ll touch on enabling custom domains and monitoring access logs, plus steps to refresh and reconfigure the repository if needed.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting measurements for layout**

I'm analyzing how we're using intrinsicWidth with getBoundingClientRect when transforms aren't applied, but our contentRef does have transforms and absolute elements. We've got a header with a fixed width of 1920px, while some internal elements are wider, with a negative left offset. It seems like I should measure using scrollWidth instead of rect.width. I’ve switched to measuring `measuredWidth = Math.max(node.scrollWidth, rect.width)`, but I'm still encountering right clipping due to the parent wrapper width being a factor.
**Fine-tuning layout for scroll**

I'm considering that the negative left offset might still allow for the proper scrollWidth calculation. However, the wrapper's width is affected by `measuredWidth * scale`, coupled with `margin: 0 auto`, which centers it. Since the transform origin is set to the top left, this might not be ideal because it can cause right-side clipping due to scaling. The wrapper doesn't have overflow hidden, meaning it should allow horizontal scrolling, but the user prefers to fit everything without a scroll. I need to account for the widest content while addressing those negative left offsets and centering.
**Adjusting layout styles**

I need to set the wrapper's margin to 0 for left alignment and consider changing it to display flex with justify-center. When using a top-left origin and matching the wrapper width to the scaled content width, the auto center margin should work. However, if there's a negative left offset, I'll need to adjust for clipping, possibly by rounding the width calculation. It looks like the user wants the site to fit perfectly across the entire project, so I should ensure the viewport meta tag is included in index.html.
**Updating layout for fit**

To prevent horizontal scrolling, I think we should update the CSS to set `overflow-x: hidden` on the body, as the user wants content to fit the screen without scrolling. Previously, we removed overflow hidden to allow scrolling, but now we’ll revert to hiding overflow. We’ll adjust the scale to fit the measured scrollWidth and change the transform origin to top center for horizontal centering. I also need to ensure the height is reserved using contentRef.getBoundingClientRect after removing the scale. Finally, I’ll implement the last tweaks, including potentially removing `margin: 0 auto`.
**Fixing layout for clipping issues**

It seems like the right clipping issue might be due to the wrapper width being smaller than the viewport. I'll set the width to 100vw to ensure no clipping occurs. I’ll calculate the scale using the viewport width relative to the measured width, without subtracting for rounding. This helps avoid overflow issues. Using `Math.floor` ensures the wrapper width doesn’t exceed the viewport. I'll make the wrapper width "100vw" and set `transformOrigin` to top center for proper horizontal centering. Finally, I'll confirm the body and HTML overflow are set to hidden while implementing these changes.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating scaling modifications**

I need to modify the scaling logic in ElementLight.jsx, but there was a tool failure due to a context mismatch. I should go back and review the file to find the exact block for the patch. The user wants the website to fit the screen without cropping the right side. We have a scaling wrapper and have previously adjusted parameters, but now we need to ensure both width fitting and no cropping. I might need to update the meta viewport in index.html as well.
**Refining implementation approach**

I need to ensure that the scale is computed as viewportWidth divided by intrinsicWidth, without subtracting one. The wrapper should be set to width: 100vw to avoid any rounding issues, and I need to be cautious about margin auto causing misalignment. For the cut on the right side, using transform-origin left seems appropriate. I must also ensure the wrapper's width matches the viewport and that overflow is visible. Additionally, I need to adjust elements inside, as fixed positions might complicate scaling.
**Clarifying fixed element behavior**

I’ve realized that fixed elements inside a transformed ancestor remain fixed relative to the viewport. CSS transforms create a containing block that can affect the behavior of `position: fixed`, making it act like `absolute` in some browsers. I need to focus on fixing the code to compute scale as viewportWidth divided by intrinsicWidth and ensure the wrapper width is set to 100vw for no horizontal cropping. I’ll also check the previous math and apply the necessary patch, ensuring we include a status update line before any tool calls.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Assessing scaling implementation**

Okay, we tried working with reference, scale, and container heights before, but the file structure has changed, so we need a more robust scaling wrapper now. The user’s question centers on making the website responsive to the viewport. To address this, I realize I need to wrap the main container with a scaling wrapper that accounts for viewport width and the intrinsic width (1920). It could be tricky with fixed positions like the header interfering with scaling.
**Analyzing container structure**

I see that the top container contains various elements with classes set for layout. The issue is that we have fixed elements positioned outside of the absolute sections within the main 1920px container. Fixed positions are relative to the viewport, not the container, which complicates scaling. If I apply a transform to the container, the fixed elements will scale but remain anchored to the viewport, potentially causing layout issues. This situation definitely seems tricky to navigate!
**Exploring fixed positioning effects**

Fixed elements are removed from the normal layout flow, and I need to think about what happens when a transform is applied to an ancestor. Specifically, if the ancestor is transformed, it can affect the containing block for fixed elements. According to the specifications, fixed positioning is generally tied to the viewport unless an ancestor has a transform, which makes it act like a relative position. So, the scaling wrapper could work, but I must also ensure we maintain vertical height to avoid content disappearing due to absolute positions.
**Calculating canvas height**

In this file, the outer canvas has a set height, but the content spans many absolute sections. To calculate the height accurately, I can't rely on scrollHeight; instead, I should define a constant for the maximum height, possibly around 5200 or 6000 based on the top coordinates, which extends up to 4684 px and other components. I remember previously using 7200, but it may be excessive. Alternatively, I could scale the wrapper height based on a specified constant while keeping the 1920 container as is.
**Implementing responsive design**

Looks like I need to set a fixed height for the content since it uses absolute top positions. I'll create a scaling wrapper around the 1920 container, ensuring it's responsive across different screen sizes. This involves transforming the wrapper to scale based on the viewport, aiming for no horizontal scroll while allowing vertical scrolling. 

I plan to introduce constants like FORMULA_HEIGHT and modify the structure minimally by importing hooks and adjusting height directly within the content references. This way, we maintain layout integrity, even with absolute children elements. I'll implement these changes carefully!
**Updating component structure**

I’m planning to modify the `ElementLight` component. First, I’ll change the import statement to include React hooks like `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useState`. I’ll then add constants like `DESIGN_WIDTH` and `CANVAS_HEIGHT` near the start for layout management.

Next, in the return statement, I need to replace the existing container with a new scaling wrapper that maintains responsiveness. This involves careful indentation and wrapping while preserving existing content. I’ll ensure the closing tags match up precisely to keep the structure intact. Let's get this patch implemented!</details></think>

---



---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning screen scaling**

To avoid horizontal scrolling, I can scale the 1920 canvas to the viewport width using a transform scale, with the transform origin set to the top left. I'll ensure the wrapper reserves space by setting its width and height to the scaled values. This is the approach I attempted previously. Now, I need to re-open the file to create an exact patch and modify the contents carefully. My next step is to wrap the inner large container with a scaling wrapper.
**Implementing scaling for component**

The component currently has an outermost container with a full-screen width and a centered grid layout. Inside, there's a fixed-width 1920 pixel container with several absolute children. To implement scaling, I plan to wrap the container with a new wrapper that applies a transform scale to the content and sets the width and height to scaled values. However, "CANVAS_HEIGHT" isn't straightforward, as absolute children extend top positions significantly. I'll need to either set a large height of 6000 pixels or compute the height by measuring the content's scrollHeight without the transform.
**Understanding scroll height issues**

I'm realizing that many children are absolutely positioned within the 1920 container, which means their scrollHeight might appear low, as absolute children aren't considered in the parent's height calculation. However, they can still impact it if the parent has a relative position and those children extend beyond the parent's bottom. Since the parent has a fixed height of 1200 pixels, we need to account for the entire content's height when scaling, which is challenging. Previously, we used a fixed CANVAS_HEIGHT to manage this.
**Planning for content scaling**

My approach here is to maintain width scaling while reserving space for height by using a fixed large canvas height that can cover the content's bottom. I need to calculate the maximum absolute extents. 

The first absolute section indicates a bottom position of 3808 pixels. The next section, while its height is unknown, could potentially add around 5000 to 5200 pixels total. To be safe, I’ll set the CANVAS_HEIGHT to 5200 or even 6000 pixels. I also need to incorporate React hooks like `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useState`, as only React is currently imported.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring Interaction Options**

I’m thinking we should propose adding baseline infrastructure like Framer Motion or stick with just CSS/JS. The user’s question is about possible solutions, so we don’t need to implement code changes immediately; I can reply succinctly and offer to help if needed.

I’ll focus on providing short, clear suggestions without unnecessary details. Using markdown headings and bullet points could help organize the information better. I can include small code snippets to demonstrate things like setting up IntersectionObserver. 

Let’s start by suggesting adding Framer Motion with a concise installation and usage example.
**Proposing Minimal Interactions**

I’m considering suggesting some minimal interactions like smooth scrolling and reveal-on-scroll effects. However, I want to hold off on any code changes until the user gives approval. I’ll respond in a structured way in Korean. 

I’ll address why interactions may not be included from Figma prototypes and offer two methods: manual implementation with examples or using libraries with installation commands. 

I could also mention mapping interactions from Figma if the user provides a link. I’ll suggest quick improvements that could be applied directly, like hover transitions and mobile navigation toggles, while keeping the response concise.
**Creating a Concise Response**

Since I'm not using any tools, I don’t need to provide status updates. I’ll incorporate memory and answer in Korean while skipping irrelevant details like white text and GitHub citations. 

I want to keep my response clear and concise, using a bullet list with minimal code snippets for IntersectionObserver and Framer Motion examples. I'll also note that CSS hover transitions are already in use with Tailwind classes. 

Let’s bring it all together and craft a final, straightforward answer!</details></think>

네, 있습니다. Figma 프로토타입의 인터랙션(탭, 전환, 스크롤 트리거)은 코드로 자동 변환되지 않아서, 프로젝트 내에서 직접 구현해야 합니다. 선택지는 크게 세 가지예요.

- 방법 1 — 가벼운 직접 구현
  - 스크롤 리빌: `IntersectionObserver`로 뷰포트 진입 시 클래스 토글
  - 스무스 스크롤: 앵커 링크 클릭 시 `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })`
  - 토글/아코디언/드롭다운: `useState`로 열림/닫힘 상태 관리
  - 호버/트랜지션: Tailwind `transition`, `hover:` 유틸로 즉시 가능

- 방법 2 — 애니메이션/컴포넌트 라이브러리 활용
  - Framer Motion: 등장/페이드/슬라이드 등 모션을 선언적으로 구현
  - GSAP/ScrollTrigger: 스크롤 연동 애니메이션 고급 제어
  - Swiper: 캐러셀/슬라이더
  - Headless UI/Radix: 접근성 보장된 모달/드롭다운 등

- 방법 3 — Figma 인터랙션 매핑(선택)
  - Figma 파일 ID를 주시면 프로토타입 정의를 참고해 어떤 화면/요소에 어떤 트리거가 있는지 목록화해, 코드로 1:1 매핑해 드릴 수 있어요.

원하시면 지금 프로젝트에 바로 적용할 핵심 세트부터 넣을 수 있어요:
- 스크롤 리빌(IntersectionObserver)
- 스무스 스크롤 내비게이션
- 모바일 메뉴 토글
- 간단한 페이드/슬라이드 인 효과(Framer Motion 선택)

먼저 어떤 인터랙션이 필요하신가요? 예: 섹션 진입 시 페이드업, 상단 내비 클릭 시 부드러운 이동, 카드 호버, 캐러셀 등. 원하시는 항목 알려주시면 바로 구현해 드릴게요.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Exploring Figma's prototype features**

I'm diving into Figma's capabilities, particularly the "prototype device" and "reactions" settings within nodes in the document. The design API has elements like `prototypeStartNodeID`, but the "reactions" are only available in file nodes through the file's JSON. I need to develop a script to fetch and filter these reactions for a simplified mapping. It also seems they wanted a connection via "MCP", but using the terminal should suffice. I might install the `figma-js` library while keeping things minimal. I'll be using Node for fetching data, which is great since it has built-in fetch capabilities now.
**Developing the Figma script**

I’m working on a script that won’t need extra dependencies! It will take `FILE_KEY` as an argument and optionally `--depth`. I'll read the `FIGMA_TOKEN` from the environment; if it's not there, I’ll print instructions on how to set it and exit if necessary. The script will fetch data from Figma’s API using the token, parse the JSON, and gather nodes with reactions to output into a `figma-reactions.json` file. 

It seems the user wants to execute something in the terminal now, so I’ll plan to run the script with a placeholder "DUMMY" to ensure the usage message is clear.
**Preparing the script for Figma reactions**

I realize our tools need non-interactive commands, so all must be fully specified. I can create the script and run it without the `FILE_KEY` to display usage instructions for the user. Alternatively, I could use an echo command to print a message prompting them to provide it. 

It might be better to implement the script and run `node scripts/fetch-figma-reactions.mjs --help` to show the help message, guiding them to send the `FILE_KEY` and token after that. 

I'll create a list of tasks: "Add fetch script" (in progress) and "Run help" (pending) to keep organized, plus I might consider adding an NPM script in `package.json` to simplify running it.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fetching interactions from Figma**

I need to move forward with the user's Figma file, specifically ID 'oj1pigv3', and fetch interactions for "Lyceum Aoto Typing." I've joined the channel and retrieved document details using the mcp TalkToFigma tool. There's a COMPONENT_SET named "Lyceum Aoto Typing," and I need to get node info for that set and find its ID, which is "134:64." I'm planning to use mcp_TalkToFigma_get_reactions to fetch reactions for the node ID.
**Processing user requests with Figma**

Next, I’m focusing on delivering results while potentially proposing a code mapping skeleton. The user previously mentioned running code connected to the terminal. Now, they've provided an ID and target, so it's time to run get_node_info for "134:64" to ensure correctness. I want to retrieve nodes info to find children and their instance variant names. I’ll also call get_reactions with that node ID and maybe gather child IDs to fetch reactions from multiple nodes. Using mcp_TalkToFigma_get_nodes_info will help here.
**Running parallel processes**

I'm going to run two tasks in parallel: I'll get node info for ID "134:64" to find any children and also retrieve reactions for that same ID. If there are children, I'll fetch their reactions too. To start, I'll be following the instructions to include a status update micro note before these tool calls. Also, I've noted that the user prefers responses in Korean, so I'll keep that in mind throughout the process. Time to call these in parallel!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying next steps**

The user's last message didn’t specifically ask for creating connectors, but the tool suggests it as the next step. The instruction mentions using the reaction_to_connector_strategy to generate parameters, but we don’t have that function available. I could call create_connections for visualization or documentation. I’ll summarize the reactions found: variant 3 has a click trigger that scrolls to component 2. I should also check if we map this to code and implement an auto-typing effect.
**Planning auto-typing implementation**

I can implement the auto-typing effect in code using CSS masks or clip-path, or by adjusting the width with state to mimic the Figma animation. The user asked if this is possible with MCP, and yes, we’ve extracted the necessary details. They likely want to proceed with a React component that animates clip width over time in a loop. I should provide the extracted interaction details and confirm the implementation, but I’ll avoid stopping for approval unless absolutely necessary. I need to decide where to place the component.
**Deciding on next steps**

I'm considering whether to extend an existing section, since the files refer to a new structure with `ContentAreaSection` and `HeaderSection`. Even though we haven’t read those files thoroughly, we might not need to now. The instructions stress providing status updates before tool calls, and while we’ve done some already, we should add brief updates in our final answer. The user originally asked if this is possible and now wants interactions from an ID. They mentioned running code to connect to the terminal, and although they didn’t explicitly ask to implement anything yet, they did say they wanted the website responsive earlier.
**Evaluating implementation options**

I’m considering whether I should generate code to replicate the Figma component, but I want to be cautious and ask first. The guideline is to keep going unless we’re blocked, and I think we can implement an `AutoTypingText` component with an increasing CSS width. We could also replicate the click-to-scroll behavior, but it seems like a static site. Instead, I should focus on providing the typing effect code and possibly integrating it into the `HeaderSection`, though I’m unsure of the content placement. It may be best to present the extracted results and options first.
**Evaluating implementation and reactions**

I can fetch all reactions from the component set's children, but so far, we’ve only got data for the root and one child (id 134:71). The user prefers Korean, and I need to avoid using white text. Since we’re integrating the MCP tool with Figma, I should present results as a concise bullet list and ask if they want to implement the typing animation in code. However, I must avoid providing code snippets unless requested. I can propose implementation and ask for specifics on placement since I'm unsure where to mount it.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing auto typing effect**

I need to integrate the "Lyceum Auto Typing" effect within a specific DOM path in the React app. The path is rooted in an XPath, but mapping it precisely is tricky due to generic indexes. Instead, I could ask the user for guidance, but the instructions tell me to make assumptions and push forward unless blocked. I think it might fit within the larger blocks in `ElementLight.jsx`, specifically in sections like `MainContentSection` or `ContentAreaSection`.
**Locating insertion points**

I need to read through specific sections like `ContentAreaSection`, `MainContentSection`, `HeaderSection`, and `FooterSection` to find the best spot for the insertion. I'll use the `functions.read_file` to access these files. By analyzing their content, I can determine the most appropriate location to implement the changes. This systematic approach should help clarify where to place the "Lyceum Auto Typing" effect seamlessly within the app's structure.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing typing effect**

I need to place a typing effect for the "Lyceum Aoto Typing" component at a specific DOM path, which the user provided as an XPath. This XPath corresponds to the React code, but the code has changed, and now `ElementLight.jsx` has a responsive scaling wrapper. The latest version of `ElementLight.jsx` shows different content without our wrapper. I need to locate where the typing effect should be inserted, given this XPath is a bit vague.
**Finding insertion point for typing effect**

I realize that "Lyceum Aoto Typing" is part of the "Lyceum English" component. I might want to create a React component that animates typing "Lyceum English" and insert it near the header or another relevant section. The earlier document shows a `SidebarSection`, but the target could also be within `ContentAreaSection`, `HeaderSection`, or `MainContentSection`. Since their files aren't part of the current snapshot, I need to open and check them for a suitable insertion point while reviewing MCP Figma tool reactions.
**Implementing typing effect component**

The user is looking for a typing effect, which is simpler to implement with an "AutoTypingText" component. I can use a CSS mask or width animation, or simulate typing letter by letter with `useEffect` and `setInterval`. I’ll create a new component file, like `src/components/TypingText.jsx`, with props for text, speed, and className.

The user provided an XPath pointing to a specific node, suggesting it might be inside the `ElementLight` markup. However, it seems ambiguous because I'm not sure if the targeted "div[3]" should go in the FooterSection or the hero area, which is likely the user's intention.
**Clarifying typing effect placement**

It sounds like the user refers to "Lyceum Aoto Typing" as the component for the typing effect, which might be placed near the left decorative line in the Figma file. I’m not entirely sure which specific on-screen spot this corresponds to, like if it’s in the hero title area. Since the instructions say to keep moving unless blocked, I could add a placeholder at the XPath path, but I'm unsure about the mapping. Instead, I might provide minimal code for the AutoTyping component and instructions for implementation, but I need to find the right container in the code first.
**Searching for the right container**

I need to find a container with nested divs that include the class "flex items-start relative self-stretch w-full." I noticed a block within an overlay that has a div with that class, followed by `<HeaderSection />`, `<MainContentSection />`, and `<FooterSection />`. This block is part of the `ElementLight` file at lines 66-70, which likely dictates a DOM structure surrounded by multiple divs. I want to insert the typing effect in the `MainContentSection` or an earlier section. I'll check the `MainContentSection.jsx` file and potentially look into `ContentAreaSection`.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing font imports and code structure**

I’m aware that we’re loading fonts in the index.html, including 'Bebas Neue,' 'Roboto Mono,' and 'Noto Sans KR,' but not 'Caveat.' We can set a fallback to 'Caveat, cursive,' although it won't be loaded. It might cause a display mismatch, but I think it's manageable.

Next, I’ll insert the component into ElementLight.jsx within the specified block. The block currently features a decorative vertical line, and our typing effect will fit in nicely. I'll maintain the code style without unnecessary comments and ensure proper file imports. After that, I'll check everything with a build to confirm, creating a todo for adding the typing effect component and properly applying any necessary changes.
**Verifying code indentation**

I’m checking the top of the file, and yep, it uses two spaces for indentation. The existing files are consistent with that, which is good! I need to implement the component while keeping the code minimal. It’s also crucial to ensure that the bundler recognizes the new file, so I should confirm that’s in place. With everything lined up, I feel ready to proceed. Let's make it happen!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing typing component**

I need to implement a typing component and insert it into a specific DOM path, which is a bit tricky because the XPath is based on document structure after modifications. The current ElementLight has undergone some transformations, and I need to add a typing effect similar to "Lyceum English." 

I'll decide where to insert this by finding the corresponding element. The user's reference suggests it should go in a logical area, maybe inside a ContentAreaSection or SidebarSection. I could also create a reusable component for better flexibility.
**Determining insertion point**

I need to figure out where exactly to place the component, but I shouldn't ask for permission to proceed. They pointed to the id "app," which leads to our root component rendering the <ElementLight />. Inside, the structure includes several wrappers and divs. 

Currently, we have a scaling wrapper, and it seems like we have nested divs before reaching the original content. I should look at the XPath, as the third inner wrapper might be where I want to insert it, possibly in the content container.
**Placing the typing component**

To satisfy the user's needs, I can place the typing component near the header area, but I think it's better to create a new component that animates text width over time. This can be achieved using CSS animations or JavaScript with state and intervals to reveal characters. 

I'll design the component to display "Lyceum English" in Caveat Bold at 128px. I need to create a file for this in `LyceumAutoTyping/LyceumAutoTyping.jsx` and import it into ElementLight. I can position it absolutely within the designated coordinates for clearer visibility, possibly near the header or in the main hero area.
**Placing "Lyceum English" text**

The "Lyceum English" text seems to come from the Figma component and is probably meant for the top-left area. I need to scan the ElementLight to find a suitable spot for this typed text since it's not currently present. I could place it near the "Decorative Line" at the L214 zone and align it absolutely. 

To implement the typing effect, I'll create a component that animates the clipping width. I’ll include props for the text and duration, and I might use CSS keyframes to animate the width from 0 to the measured content width, even if that's initially unknown. Maybe using monospace could help!
**Implementing typing component**

I could use JavaScript to measure the text element's `scrollWidth` with `useRef` and set the state for width, animating it via CSS transition with a timeout for incremental character reveals. This way, I can replicate the typing effect for "Lyceum English."

I need to create this in `src/components/LyceumAutoTyping.jsx`, keeping the structure under `sections`. Then, I’ll insert it into ElementLight, positioning it absolutely to match the Figma layout. I notice I need to load the Caveat font, which isn’t currently imported. I'll modify the index.html to include it via Google Fonts, or I can use Tailwind for a fallback. I’ll proceed to update everything, pinpointing the correct insertion location and applying necessary patches.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating XPath placement**

I see that the XPath `//*[@id="app"]/div/div/div/div/div/div[3]/div/div` corresponds to a deep nested structure under `#app`. However, it's a bit ambiguous for our code. The user mentioned this is the spot for the "auto typing" feature, perhaps in `SidebarSection`, which also handles communication. The text is "Lyceum English." In the Figma, this corresponds to decorative text near the top. I think it might be better to ask the user where exactly to place it visually, but the instruction says to proceed without asking.
**Exploring Component Insertion**

I'm trying to figure out how to achieve proper rendering under `#app` within a strict mode context. However, the current `ElementLight.jsx` doesn't provide access to the substructure needed. The runtime DOM includes our wrappers, but matching them is tricky. Instead, I’m considering creating a helper hook to mount the component using XPath with a utility that employs `document.evaluate`. This would allow me to integrate the `LyceumAutoTyping` component correctly into the desired location while using `ReactDOM.createRoot` for rendering. I can implement a `MountAtXPath` component for this task.
**Creating a Portal Component**

I need to ensure we avoid multiple renders to prevent duplication, using the effect with cleanup is essential here. Using a React portal seems like a better solution by leveraging `ReactDOM.createPortal` to insert into the found DOM element. To accomplish this, I can create a wrapper component that manages the target element using state and returns the portal once found. It may be simpler to implement `LyceumAutoTypingPortal.jsx`, which receives the `xpath` as a prop and renders into that container using `createPortal`. I'll import `createPortal` from 'react-dom' for this.
**Implementing MountAtXPath Component**

I'm implementing a new file called `src/components/MountAtXPath.jsx`. This file will import necessary hooks and `createPortal` from React. The function `evaluateXPath(xpath)` will find the target node based on the provided XPath. The `MountAtXPath` component will use `useEffect` to search for and set the target, returning `null` until it’s found. Once found, it will create a portal for the children. 

In `ElementLight.jsx`, I’ll include `<MountAtXPath xpath='//*[@id="app"]/div/div/div/div/div/div[3]/div/div'><LyceumAutoTyping className="..." /></MountAtXPath>`. I’ll make sure the class names align with the styles, and I'll keep an eye on indentation for consistency!
**Setting Up MountAtXPath**

I’m reviewing the project files and noticing that there’s a two-space indentation style. I’ll keep that as I create `src/components/MountAtXPath.jsx`. First, I need to set up the components directory since it doesn’t exist yet. After adding the file, I’ll update `ElementLight.jsx` to import and render the new portal inside the top-level wrapper `<div>` with `style width:100vw`. It’s fine to place the portal under the outermost `<div ... data-model-id>`. 

I’ll run minimal lint checks and provide a brief update afterward. Oh, and I'll remember that the user prefers Korean!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating code structure**

I'm considering how to locate by a stable ID or data attribute in the code. We had a `data-model-id="72:293"` earlier, and it seems it still exists in the top div of the current ElementLight. However, it looks like, in the new file, the wrapper structure is different compared to last time. The XPath I’m looking at is trying to navigate through multiple nested divs, and I’m realizing that the hierarchy is changing. This might affect where elements are being inserted.
**Proposing implementation options**

I should suggest two options for inserting an element: either replace XPath with a CSS selector using `data-model-id` and a specific class or create a simple stable anchor. This would involve adding an empty container div with the ID 'lyceum-typing-mount' in the desired location of the JSX for robustness. I want to clarify with the user where they prefer to place it: maybe near the `SidebarSection` or within `ContentAreaSection`. They provided a specific path, but I think it's faster to ask for a screenshot to ensure accuracy!
**Planning proactive adjustments**

It seems like I need to provide clear solution instructions for this. I'll add a mount node inside the React section, but I’m unsure whether the best spot is the HeaderSection or in the ContentAreaSection header titled "CURRICULUM." The user mentioned the "Lyceum Auto Typing," which might fit near the decorative line next to the English text. Since they gave a generic path, I’m considering a "Pick" tool to click and capture elements, but efficiency is key. I’ll log the resolved element and propose adjusting the XPath. I might also suggest rendering the component directly in `SidebarSection`. I should ask the user about their preferred section!
**Addressing the XPath issue**

I noticed that the current XPath is no longer matching due to the addition of a scaling wrapper. To resolve this, I can suggest three options:  

1) Insert directly within the correct React component,  
2) Add an empty mount div in the desired location for a portal,  
3) Update the XPath.  

I think the second option is best—placing `<div id="lyceum-typing-mount" />` inside the `SidebarSection` under the header title, which aligns with the user's previous mention of "Lyceum Auto Typing." I might want to confirm this placement with a quick pick to ensure clarity!
**Implementing changes in SidebarSection**

The instructions suggest I can proceed without seeking approval unless I'm blocked. So, I’m opting for option 2: adding an anchor in `SidebarSection` and changing `index.jsx` to mount at `#lyceum-typing-mount`. I plan to edit `SidebarSection.jsx` to include a placeholder container right after the header and before the description text.

I'll update `src/index.jsx` to use querySelector instead of XPath, which seems simpler. I could modify `MountAtXPath` for this, but I think it’s easier to create a new `MountAtSelector.jsx`. I’ll import `LyceumAutoTyping` directly into `SidebarSection.jsx`, ensuring it has the correct styling, and remove unnecessary portal usages from `index.jsx`. I'll proceed to implement these changes now.</details></think>

아니 위치는 정확한데 그 애니메이션 자체가 이상하다고

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing animation issues**

I need to tackle the user's complaint regarding the animation looking wrong. They want the Lyceum Auto Typing effect to match the Figma component using a mask or width reveal. Currently, our implementation uses text substring typing, which might not fit the desired style and spacing. They pointed out that "그 애니메이션 자체가 이상." To address this, I’ll shift to a mask/clip reveal method, animating the full text revealing smoothly from left to right, rather than character by character. Implementing CSS clip-path or width animation will help achieve this.
**Improving animation with masking**

I’m thinking of a better approach for the animation, focusing on real masking. I want to use a wrapper with overflow hidden to measure the text width, then animate the mask width using requestAnimationFrame or CSS keyframe animation from 0 to the computed width. I should also include an optional caret. The text uses the "Caveat" font, Bold 128 px, which isn’t currently loaded. Right now, index.html only imports other fonts like Noto Sans KR. So, I'll update this to include Caveat, which might resolve the visual mismatch and improve letter spacing.
**Enhancing with Tailwind CSS**

I can also use Tailwind CSS, but the inline style specifies a font family including Caveat fallback. Without importing it, the font defaults to something like Apple SD Gothic Neo, which looks incorrect. To fix this, I’ll add a new @import for Google Fonts 'Caveat:700' in index.html. Next, I’ll implement the LyceumAutoTyping component with mask animation. The plan is to wrap the text in a container with position relative, and use a span for the inner text, alongside an absolute-positioned overlay caret.
**Animating smooth reveals**

I need to rely on JavaScript to measure the span's offsetWidth and then animate the width of the mask div using CSS transitions or keyframes. A simpler method would be measuring the text width after mounting and then setting the maskWidth state. I can animate the width from 0 to the measured width using `setTimeout(() => setProgress(1))`. They mentioned the animation is wrong, so I’ll ensure the reveal matches the Figma “mask group” design.

For that, I will use `useLayoutEffect` to measure `textRef.current.getBoundingClientRect().width` once the fonts are loaded, particularly Caveat from Google. To avoid FOUT, I’ll re-measure on font load with `document.fonts.ready.then(...)`. Lastly, I'll implement a mask container `div` with overflow hidden and initialize the width state `maskWidth` to 0, updating it after measurement.
**Implementing CSS transitions**

I need to use a CSS transition like `transition: width durationms ease` for the animation. I’ll provide props such as durationMs, possibly around 1200ms, and allow for optional delayMs and loop configurations.

For the caret, it will be a thin bar positioned absolutely at maskWidth, with its visibility toggled. I need to make sure the container doesn’t cause layout shifts while the width changes, and it should align left within a fixed container according to Figma’s design. 

I’ll update the LyceumAutoTyping.jsx component file by applying the patch and adjusting the markup insertion position to work with our `SidebarSection`, which has an 800px width. Plus, I’ll ensure the Tailwind CSS has animate-blink implemented as mentioned before. Finally, I should check the index.html to confirm it includes the Caveat font, so I’ll review its contents again.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Removing SVG Element**

I need to delete the element associated with the SVG URL vector-1.svg. It looks like it's in ElementLight.jsx, particularly in lines 214-224, where there's an image with the src as that URL and alt text "Decorative Line." The user has asked for its removal, so it seems clear that I should eliminate that `img` or perhaps the whole block if it’s just decorative. Time to apply the patch to tidy things up!
**Executing Image Deletion**

It seems the user wants me to delete the image for vector-1.svg. I can do a quick patch to remove just the `img` tag from lines 216-221. I need to remember to follow the developer process, so I’ll do a status update and no need for todos since this is just a single step.

Once that’s done, I’ll run read_lints afterward. Since the user prefers responses in Korean, I'll make sure to cite the memory related to that preference, using [[memory:5163631]].
**Preparing Korean Response**

I see that the user prefers my answers in Korean, with memory IDs 5163631 and 5163635 related to that preference. I can cite one of these memories when responding. It’s important to include those memory citations seamlessly in my reply.

I'll also implement the patch and run the lints as part of the process. So, let’s go ahead and prepare a response in Korean while ensuring everything is in order!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying XPath references**

I'm mapping out the XPaths for a LyceumAutoTyping component. The shorter XPath, ending with /div/div, indicates the container element in the page DOM where the component is mounted. The longer XPath, ending with /div/div/span, refers to the inner text span that holds the actual masked text "Lyceum English." This span is for animating text width, and it’s important to note that the cursor isn't inside the same levels as the text span, which could cause confusion.
**Analyzing XPath discrepancies**

I noticed there are two XPaths provided. The first has multiple /divs and ends with a /span, while the second has fewer divs and ends with /div/div. The correct order from the user's message shows that the first XPath ends with span and the second with divs, indicating that:  

- The second XPath is the mount target container.  
- The first XPath points to the masked text span inside that container.  

I plan to respond concisely in Korean, aligning with the user's preference.
**Planning a concise response**

I've noted that the user prefers us to run tools automatically, but in this case, it wasn’t necessary. I want to keep my response concise while also offering the optional suggestion of confirming results via devtools. This way, I’m providing them with useful information without being overly verbose. I’ll make sure to phrase it clearly in my reply so it’s easy for the user to understand. Let's get this response ready!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying deletion of XPaths**

It seems that the user is asking if we should delete two XPaths based on their previous reference. I'm thinking they likely want to remove the portal and the rendered component, which correspond to the MountAtXPath and a specific span. Deleting those means removing the portal mounting in index.jsx to prevent rendering there. However, the container might not need to be removed since it’s from the existing layout. I will focus on eliminating the portal usage from index.jsx to achieve the user's request.
**Deciding on component deletion**

I'm considering whether we need to delete the component file. It may not be necessary; the user might just want to eliminate the specific DOM injection. I'll focus on removing the portal usage and providing a concise status update. The tooling requires management, but since it's a single change, we could skip the todo. I’ll apply the patch to remove imports and JSX, read the file again, and run the lint checks. I'll also remember to respond in Korean since that's the user's preference.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating ElementLight changes**

I noticed that we modified earlier content multiple times, and the last read of ElementLight.jsx shows different scaling wrappers. It initially had a top structure with a specific div class, but then switched to a simplified version. We later added a scaling wrapper again successfully. Now, we need to pinpoint the correct element to delete based on XPath. The generic XPath here is tricky because counting nested divs is complicated, especially when linking to the component structure.
**Clarifying DOM structure changes**

The user mentioned a specific container that's missing a trailing div, which might be the parent of the previous injection target they want to remove from the DOM. I need to figure out which code creates that container. The earlier structure includes several nested divs and specifics like 'absolute w-[1920px] h-[1447px] top-[681px] left-0' from the 'SidebarSection'. The user rejected removing changes from index.jsx, which means the portal injection likely still exists after all our adjustments and attempts to modify it.
**Implementing XPath deletion**

Earlier, the user accepted changes to src/index.jsx twice, but now their latest request to remove the portal has been rejected, which means the portal is still active. They want to delete an element at a specific XPath, and while we could hide it with CSS, XPath isn’t compatible with CSS selectors. Instead, using 'MountAtXPath' could let us remove the element through DOM manipulation. However, I need to approach this carefully since deleting DOM elements in React can lead to issues. So, I'll implement a utility that removes the node matching the XPath when mounted.
**Creating RemoveByXPath component**

I’m thinking of adding a 'RemoveByXPath' component that finds and removes an element based on the specified XPath. Since the user rejected previous changes to index.jsx, I'll need to create this new component and render it carefully. They previously accepted changes, including the portal injection, but there's no guarantee they'll accept this as well. I’ll implement the new file src/components/RemoveByXPath.jsx, utilizing useEffect to locate and remove the child node. Finally, I need to ensure everything is integrated seamlessly in src/index.jsx without breaking any linter rules.</details></think>

Read file: undefined

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating user request in Korean**

The user wants to delete an element at a specific XPath. There’s some complexity because they recently rejected changes to a file, but it seems the target is a container div that might affect the layout since our portal is mounted there. I need to be mindful that deleting it could impact how things display. Still, the user’s request is clear since they asked me to "지워볼래" (let's try to delete it).
**Analyzing portal mount issues**

I need to prevent the portal from mounting under the container the user wants to delete, or consider removing the element that’s causing that container. But there’s a challenge: I don’t have clear mapping in the React tree for the specific XPath. It looks like the structure has changed; we previously transformed ElementLight into a scaled wrapper, but it was rewritten to have a fixed layout. Now, ElementLight seems flat and static, without using the scale wrapper anymore. That might complicate things!
**Exploring ElementLight structure**

I'm looking at the ElementLight.jsx path, where we previously removed vector-1.svg. The layout has a large outer div with a grid and a white background, and there's an inner div with a specific width and height. The XPath structure points to a nested div within the React component hierarchy, suggesting many layers of wrapping divs. The current index.jsx includes MountAtXPath, which targets that same nested structure. It seems the third sibling div is part of a larger chain inside the root div, which complicates the layout!
**Considering deletion options**

I’m thinking about the simplest way to handle the user’s request to delete a div at a specific XPath. Since the MountAtXPath is a descendant of that div, removing it means the portal can’t mount anymore. They specifically requested a removal, so I can implement a solution by adjusting MountAtXPath to find and remove that node during the mount process. It feels a bit hacky, but I could create a 'DOMCleanup' effect to handle this. Alternatively, I might just eliminate the part of ElementLight that corresponds to that div.
**Planning component for removal**

I’m looking to create a utility component named `RemoveByXPath` to help remove nodes based on XPath, targeting the node at a specific path. I’ll add a `RemoveAtXPath` component to the index.jsx for automatic handling, keeping the user's preference for minimal Korean text in mind. The plan is to implement the code that uses `document.evaluate` to find and remove the node on mount. I'll also make sure to adhere to linting rules and match indentation styles. Lastly, I want to keep the user updated on our progress while referencing their previous feedback. Let's execute this!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating element removal effects**

I’m thinking about how removing an element from the hierarchy before mount can shift index positions. The portal attaches to the node, but if we removed a "div" higher up, it might affect the index. The mount target is under the root of the content, and that earlier removed block could be a sibling in the same chain, causing an offset. To fix this, I should use a more stable selector, like adding an explicit id or data-testid for targeting.
**Optimizing XPath for stability**

I'm considering adjusting the XPath to use a more specific attribute-based path instead of relying on position. For example, I could target a wrapper with a data-model-id or add a placeholder anchor element with a unique id within the desired container. The user wants to maintain certain locations, but since removing a background div altered the DOM, the existing MountAtXPath may now refer to a different node. So, I need to ensure the target is more resilient to changes in the structure!
**Proposing anchor element integration**

I'm thinking the assistant should add an anchor element with an id in the desired container in JSX, but the user has previously mentioned not wanting to edit the structure. They used XPath for referring to the auto-typing, and after deleting the mask-group background, the auto typing position changed. So, I should suggest making MountAtXPath use a semantic anchor instead. I could insert a `<div id="typing-anchor" />` at the old target path, but I'm unsure about which component contains that subtree. I could also enhance MountAtXPath to locate the container using a more robust query!
**Fixing XPath issues quickly**

I need to address this promptly. The easiest solution is to update the XPath to the correct path, but the user likely wants to keep the original location. They haven't provided a new XPath, and I recall them saying earlier that they preferred the original. After reverting to the XPath mount and changing the DOM by removing a block, the path changed. Without running the app, I can't compute a new path, but I can suggest using an id anchor near the expected area in the JSX.
**Proposing anchor addition for stability**

I think we can use stable attributes to encode the path and add a dedicated placeholder in `ElementLight.jsx`, where the container is defined. However, the user preferred not to modify the structure. They accepted previous changes, so I could suggest adding a placeholder for `id="typing-anchor"`. This would fix the mount issue without extensive explanations. The absolute XPath method is brittle, and since indices changed, I’ll propose these options: add an anchor or adjust the XPath to the new structure. Should I proceed with adding the anchor?</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting XPath for stability**

I need to reset the auto-typing component to its original position. The earlier XPath “//*[@id='app']/div/div/div/div/div/div[3]/div/div” was working, but changes to the DOM after removing a decorative div have messed things up. I should inspect the current DOM structure to find a stable XPath, but the simplest solution might be to revert to the original position. Still, the user mentioned wanting those decorative elements removed before, so my options are limited.
**Updating XPath for auto typing**

They want the auto-typing component back at the same visual spot, so I need to update the portal XPath accordingly. Previously, they used MountAtXPath and LyceumAutoTyping in index.jsx. Although there were earlier rejections of changes, they've accepted previous edits, and now I see it's present in the open_and_recent file. I need to identify the correct path since a block was removed, but counting nested divs from the app root is proving tricky.
**Considering anchor for stability**

I could set up an ID anchor near the original location in JSX and update the XPath to target that, like using "//*[@id='typing-anchor']" to ensure reliability. However, the user only asked to revert the changes, so adding this markup might seem like more than just a simple fix. They didn't want to embed anything in the Sidebar earlier, but using a placeholder div like 'typing-mount' could work. I need to find out which React file renders that container since the mount path is deep inside.
**Exploring XPath alternatives**

It seems this might correspond to the "flex flex-col w-[1920px] items-start pt-[159px]..." area, which is tricky. I could use the same XPath but adjust the index for the removed block, as removing one div would change the index; it might be div[2] now instead of [3]. However, I'm hesitant to guess without confirming the runtime DOM. Another option is to use MountAtXPath with document.querySelector by class instead. Since the user requested to revert to the original position, I could adjust the MountAtXPath to target the last child container under a known structure. It might help to clarify their intent!
**Implementing anchor for MountAtXPath**

Since I can't compute the exact path right now, I can inject an anchor into the layout where I want to mount the content. The suitable locations could be `SidebarSection` or `ContentAreaSection`. The user mentioned a specific vector in the area we removed, so I’ll create a stable anchor at that location by adding a `<div id="typing-anchor">` inside the ElementLight component. I’ll also update MountAtXPath to target this anchor and preserve the original position. 

To ensure accuracy, I’ll allow MountAtXPath to accept an array of XPaths to find the correct node. Let's proceed with updating the components and making sure everything is functional without introducing new issues!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Assessing component imports**

I see that we have `LyceumAutoTyping` imported from `../sections/LyceumAutoTyping`, but it seems that `ElementLight.jsx` has not imported this component, despite its earlier content changing so much. I need to make sure to include it at the top of `ElementLight.jsx` with the correct path: `import { LyceumAutoTyping } from "./sections/LyceumAutoTyping";`.  

I’ll also double-check that the portal has been removed from `src/index.jsx`, ensuring that only `ElementLight` is rendered now. Lastly, I need to plan how to incorporate `LyceumAutoTyping` with consistent styling.
**Revising layout for typing component**

I see that the original area has small dimensions (70x230) within a larger 1699x367 container, while the mask text in Figma is quite wide. This presents a challenge since we'll need to fit the typing component, which might require the full width of "Lyceum English." I'll align it to the left within the container. The plan is to create a wrapper with absolute positions, similar to before.

First, I need to import the component and then check the current `ElementLight.jsx` to find the exact spot for the adjustments. I'll use `read_file` for that.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating mask positioning**

I think we want the mask area with a width of around 70. The variants from Figma had incremental widths, with the initial one being 70. For a typical effect, we could position the container absolutely at the outer wrapper's top 416px and left 47px. The user just wants it restored to its original position, so I'll use those offsets to ensure alignment. Also, I'll maintain the z-index and implement it within ElementLight.jsx where the previous comment was removed.
**Importing LyceumAutoTyping component**

I’m planning to import the LyceumAutoTyping component at the top of the ElementLight.jsx file, or maybe inside it for better organization. The path is clear: it's located in src/screens/ElementLight/sections/LyceumAutoTyping. I can import it as `{ LyceumAutoTyping }` from the sections' folder since they're in the same directory.

I’ll create an HTML block to properly display it and ensure that everything doesn’t conflict. Plus, I need to make sure to remove any duplicate typing from the SidebarSection since we've already added that before.
**Updating SidebarSection and ElementLight**

The user wants to restore the original location, so I need to remove the related codes from the SidebarSection. This means I'll take out the import statements and the div block there.

Next, I should update the SidebarSection to ensure everything aligns correctly. The index.jsx doesn't currently include MountAtXPath, which is good to note! I will then adjust the ElementLight.jsx file to import and insert the LyceumAutoTyping component in place of the placeholder comment. I’ll keep the code indentation consistent, using two spaces as per the project’s style, and make sure to update Tailwind classes as needed.
**Running checks and updates**

Next, I'll run `read_lints` on both files to check for any issues. After that, I’ll inform the user that the position has been restored, but I want to keep the status update concise.

I need to stick to the developer's instructions for status updates, especially when using tools. So, I’ll include a brief micro-update at the beginning of my messages, as per the status_update_spec. The final message will be minimal and in Korean. Alright, let's go ahead and perform the patches!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing visibility of text**

I see that only the letter "L" is currently visible. The way I'm using the LyceumAutoTyping component involves a container with specific dimensions that clips the typing span. This outer container has a width of 70px and height of 230px, which limits visibility. To fix this, I can either increase the wrapper's width to show the entire text, remove the overflow hidden, or set the width to auto. Another option is to position the typing inside the container while removing the overflow hidden.
**Adjusting typing visibility**

I noticed that the previous mask group had a narrow width of 70px with a vertical line, but the user wants the auto-typing to display the full width. I need to edit the ElementLight.jsx file to set the wrapper width to something larger, like 1200px or even the full width at 1699px. I'll also center it and remove overflow hidden. 

Additionally, in the LyceumAutoTyping component, the mask div is positioned absolutely, but its parent container must be wide enough to display the full text properly. I'll check the component's code, focusing on the relative parent div and its inline-block display properties.
**Analyzing div positioning**

I’m looking at a div with absolute positioning in the top left, but it has a maskWidth and overflow hidden. Since it’s inside a relative parent that lacks defined width or height, this causes issues. The mask div displays the text span, but with no background, and the caret span is placed nearby. Because the mask div is absolute, it doesn’t contribute to the overall width, which might be why only the letter "L" is visible due to these wrapper constraints.
**Adjusting mask structure**

I noticed that the mask width animates from 0 to full width, which works well. However, the outer container's width of 70px might overshadow the typing. The child’s absolute positioning leaves the parent’s width at zero, which explains why only the caret or minimal width is visible. To solve this, it's better to avoid absolute positioning in LyceumAutoTyping. I'll use a wrapper div with a width equal to maskWidth and overflow hidden. Changing the mask wrapper to a relative position will help it contribute to layout width properly.
**Simplifying wrapper settings**

I’m thinking of removing width constraints and overflow hidden in the ElementLight wrapper. I plan to increase the wrapper width to 1200px and eliminate overflow hidden to enhance visibility. The absolute mask won’t set the parent width, leading to issues where the parent remains at zero. To fix this, I need to change the wrapper to either fit-content or auto, and ensure its width is sufficient to avoid clipping. 

I should also validate imports before proceeding with the apply_patch tool call. Let's get this change done!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering cursor positioning**

I’m thinking about the current structure, which includes a wrapper with a relative position and an inner absolute mask div. What if I make the cursor absolutely positioned inside the outer container to align better? However, including the cursor in the masked text container might clip it. I want to ensure the cursor sticks to the end of the visible text, so I’m considering setting its left position relative to the width. I think keeping showCursor default as true aligns with the user’s desire for a visible cursor.
**Adjusting cursor behavior**

The user mentioned the cursor was previously at the front, so I need to implement a dynamic cursor position. They haven't asked for changes in the code usage, but they expect it to work correctly. I think I should set showCursor to default true, even though it was changed to false before. It seems safe to pass showCursor as true in ElementLight.

For implementation, I’ll track the maskWidth state in LyceumAutoTyping and calculate the text width accordingly. I want the cursor to align correctly and ensure maskWidth updates upon resizing to maintain functionality.
**Implementing cursor within scale transform**

I’m looking at how the scale transform interacts with the maskWidth, which is calculated from the scrollWidth of textRef during the mount phase. Even though the scale transform on the ancestor doesn't affect the scrollWidth, that’s okay because the text's baseline size remains fixed at 128 px. The maskWidth is measured in CSS pixels. Since both the cursor and wrapper are within the same transform, they will align properly.

For the implementation, I plan to change the rendering to create an absolutely positioned cursor within the same relative container in LyceumAutoTyping.jsx. We already have the necessary containerRef, textRef, and maskWidth state ready to go.
**Adding a cursor element**

I'm planning to introduce a new element for the cursor. The structure will include a relative container with an absolute mask div for the text, and then if showCursor is true, an absolutely positioned blink cursor to the right of the text. 

I need to ensure the wrapper is wide enough to prevent layout shifts, possibly by setting the width to measured fullWidth. I also want to calculate the text height from textRef.offsetHeight and manage states for textHeight and the cursor height. It might be better to compute this instead of using a constant value.
**Updating cursor visibility**

I need to ensure that showCursor is set to true in the usage within ElementLight.jsx where we render <LyceumAutoTyping>. I'll change the code to reflect this while keeping the default as false but passing true when needed. 

I also want to adjust the blink style with a 1px offset and ensure proper indentation during the code edits. After making these changes, I’ll run the linting to check everything is structured correctly. Let’s proceed with the implementation!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing vertical clipping**

I need to fix the issue with vertical clipping. The typing mask wrapper height is set to the textHeight, while the cursor height is at 96. The text style includes a font size of 128 with a line height of 161.28. My outer container, a div around LyceumAutoTyping, has a set height of 230. Inside, the textHeight is derived from el.offsetHeight, which seems to be around 154. The absolute positioning of the mask container might be causing clipping because it's set to textHeight, while the text extends above the baseline.
**Investigating text height and masking**

Alternatively, the outer absolute holder might be too small. The text height is set to 128 plus some additional height. The line height is 161.28, while the masking container uses textHeight based on offsetHeight. If the measurement occurs before the mask width is set, it could be 0 at the start. I've noticed that the mask container's initial width is also 0, which could lead to incorrect height calculations. I set the text height to el.offsetHeight or default to 128, but it might still be too small, causing cropping issues.
**Optimizing height measurement**

To approach this safely, I think I should set the height to the lineHeight or use the computed bounding box with clientHeight after temporarily removing any width restriction. I can measure height using getBoundingClientRect when the text position is static and no mask is applied. I'll set the maximum width to none and remove clipPath to get an accurate measurement. Since the parent width is initially 0, the computed height might still be valid due to font height, even if the parent has overflow hidden.
**Ensuring robust height settings**

To create a more robust solution, I should set the height style to the numeric lineHeight of 161.28 or compute it from the element's style using parseFloat(getComputedStyle(el).lineHeight). Rather than relying on offsetHeight, I'll set the textHeight using the computed line height and adjust the cursor height to about 0.85 times that value. To prevent vertical clipping, I’ll ensure the container's height accommodates textHeight plus a safe padding of around 20 px. Additionally, I can set the parent's overflow to visible to avoid any cropping issues.
**Implementing height adjustments**

In ElementLight, the wrapper height is set to 230, which should be enough, but cropping is happening in the mask. To fix this, I should set the mask container height to the textHeight plus descent. Instead of using offsetHeight, I’ll use computedLineHeight from getComputedStyle and adjust the height accordingly. I’ll also add vertical padding of 4 px for the wrapper and modify the cursor height to textHeight minus 8. Finally, I’ll ensure the outer container’s overflow is set to visible, and then I’ll implement the patch.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Clarifying font licensing**

I need to address the user's question about font licensing with a focus on commercial use. The inquiry is in Korean, and they prefer a concise response without white text.

So, here’s a breakdown: “Caveat” is a Google Fonts font that’s free for commercial use under the SIL Open Font License. “Apple SD Gothic Neo” is an Apple system font, and while it's allowed for use on Apple platforms, redistributing it through the web isn’t, although system usage is fine. Lastly, “Helvetica” requires a font license for web embedding.
**Explaining font usage in CSS**

I need to clarify that when referencing Helvetica in a CSS font-family fallback, it utilizes the installed system font on user devices. However, self-hosting Helvetica without a license isn’t permitted.

The generic sans-serif fallback is fine to use. I should include citations for known links, even though I haven't used a web search tool. To keep it informative, I can mention links like the Google Fonts page for “Caveat,” the OFL license page, and Apple’s font license information. I just need to avoid browsing for fresh content.
**Summarizing font licensing details**

It looks like I didn’t get additional links, but I can still provide helpful information without them by outlining key points concisely.

For "Caveat," it’s a Google Font under the OFL, allowing commercial use; I can reference the Google Fonts page. 

"Apple SD Gothic Neo" is a system font where commercial use is okay in rendered content, but redistributing or web-embedding the font file isn’t permitted. I should reference the Apple Fonts FAQ.

Finally, "Helvetica" requires a license for commercial use; self-hosting isn’t allowed, but referencing system-installed Helvetica is acceptable. I'll mention the Monotype licensing page as a reference.
**Responding in Korean and offering alternatives**

I’ll answer in Korean and suggest safer alternatives. I can mention using “Caveat” from Google Fonts, and for Korean fallback, “Noto Sans KR” is already in the project. If they're looking for a commercial-safe web-embeddable alternative to Helvetica, I can suggest “Inter,” “Pretendard,” or “Noto Sans.”

Since their question implies a broader stack, I'll clarify: "Caveat" is okay, "Apple SD Gothic Neo" cannot be redistributed, and Helvetica needs a license. To ensure a consistent look, avoid relying on those fonts and ship web fonts with explicit licenses.</details></think>

---

- Caveat: Google Fonts(OFL 1.1)로 상업적 사용·배포·임베딩 가능. 단, 폰트 파일 수정·재배포 시 라이선스 동봉 및 Reserved Font Name 준수.
- Apple SD Gothic Neo: macOS/iOS 시스템 폰트. 상업적 화면 표시 사용은 가능하지만 폰트 파일 자체의 재배포/웹폰트로 호스팅은 불가.
- Helvetica: 상용 폰트. 웹 임베딩/자체 호스팅에는 별도 라이선스 필요. 사용자 OS에 설치된 Helvetica를 폰트 패밀리로 참조하는 것은 가능하나 일관성 보장은 어려움.

권장:
- 웹에서 일관성·법적 안정성 위해 Caveat를 Google Fonts로 로드하고, 한국어·UI 본문은 `Noto Sans KR`(이미 사용 중)이나 `Inter/Roboto` 같은 오픈 라이선스 웹폰트로 대체하세요.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Mapping Figma interactions**

I need to use MCP Figma tools to join the sqj544wk channel and query reactions for relevant nodes, likely in the UI library. The first step is to connect to the Figma document channel "sqj544wk" to get document info and search for nodes, especially in the prototype. The user mentioned a Figma design link, so I’ll perform actions like joining the channel, getting document info, and identifying node IDs, particularly for node "72:557".
**Fetching node interactions**

I have the document info, so I can try to get info for node "72:557". I'll search for children with types COMPONENT or FRAME and get reactions, possibly including nested ones. The get_reactions tool expects an array of node IDs, but we might not know them all. So, I’ll call get_reactions on the parent node "72:557" and see what it returns. I should first join the channel, get document info, and then proceed with the node info and reactions. After that, I'll implement the mapping in code, keeping in mind that the user wants prototype interactions too.
**Preparing to implement mapping**

I need to start by summarizing the mapping process and ensure I'm ready to implement it. The development instruction suggests to keep going until everything is resolved. I might need to add code for button click mapping in React, but I must first identify which components relate to those buttons, likely the navigation items in ElementLight's top nav. They already exist in the navigation, so I can map them to anchor sections. Given the complexity, I’ll use todo_write to track tasks like fetching prototype interactions, mapping them to app routes/anchors, and implementing click handlers. I'll begin by fetching those interactions. For this, I’ll execute parallel tool calls: joining the channel sqj544wk, getting document info, and retrieving node info and reactions for "72:557". It sounds like a good plan to batch these calls!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Mapping interactions and preferences**

We can add anchors with specific IDs at appropriate sections, like ContentAreaSection or SidebarSection, but I'm not sure about the exact mapping. I could create hidden anchors for sections, but the user asked me to fetch interactions instead of implementing anything. They want the interactions list presented succinctly, mentioning “그것도 들고와볼래.” I should also remember that the user prefers responses in Korean, so I’ll make sure to respond in that language!
**Clarifying citations and mappings**

I’ve noted that the user dislikes white text, but I think that’s not particularly relevant. I need to remember the rule about link citations. The user provided a web search result for the Anima URL, but it doesn't seem necessary to include that. We can include Figma interactions without external links, though any web search results should be cited if referenced. I’ll create a concise bullet list mapping 'Item' to destination IDs and transition details, and then ask if they want to wire them to code.
**Drafting a Korean response and interaction plan**

I'm going to create a concise Korean response with a short list of actions for the user:  

- Item(72:558) 클릭 → SCROLL_TO 72:342, easing gentle, duration 1.022s  
- Item(72:564) → 72:407  
- Item(72:567) → 72:422  
- Item(72:570) → 72:460  

Then I’ll say: "원하면 페이지 섹션에 앵커 id 추가하고 클릭 시 smooth scroll로 동일 동작 구현하겠다; 어느 버튼과 어느 섹션 매핑인지 알려주세요." I need confirmation on the mapping since assumptions can be risky. Let's also ask the user for the next step since they want the interactions extracted, which we're ready to provide!
**Providing a status update**

According to developer specifications, I need to include a micro-update near the top before any calls. The final user-visible message should reflect that style. Even though I've already used tools in this turn, I’ll add a sentence like, "Figma에서 해당 노드의 인터랙션을 가져왔습니다. 결과는 아래와 같습니다." I’ll include that update, but since the "summary_spec" suggests including a summary only when code changes, we can skip that part for now. Alright, time to respond!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Simplifying ID Assignments**

I'm looking to simplify by adding IDs to four anchor elements. First, I’ll set `id="section-image-top"` on the wrapper around the 1920x? background image. Next, I need an ID for the 3c45 image container, which has a specific height and width. 

I'll set an ID for the heading wrapper of '연지센터' and create an ID for the COMMUNICATION section's sidebar wrapper. Finally, I want to implement a smooth scroll function for the navigation items that maps to these anchor IDs.
**Mapping Navigation Items**

I'm working on mapping the navigation items which are ABOUT, CLASS, Magazine, and COMMUNICATION to their respective section IDs. I think I can just map the indices 0 to 3 to the section IDs in order: sectionImageTop, sectionLargeImage, sectionCenterHeading, and sectionCommunication, since the user didn't specify names. 

Next, I need to implement a helper function `scrollToId(id)` using `document.getElementById` and `scrollIntoView({behavior:'smooth', block:'start'})`. I realize that because the content is within a scaled wrapper, the scroll positions might differ, but `scrollIntoView` should still function correctly. I’ll figure out the offset related to the scaling as I go.
**Clarifying Scroll Behavior and Element Mapping**

I'm figuring out that while the transformed element's offsetTop is unscaled, the visual representation is scaled. The outer `contentRef` has a transform scale, and the anchor elements are nested within this container. That should be fine since we used reserved scaled heights. 

I’ll need to set `scroll-behavior: smooth` in CSS and implement this in `ElementLight.jsx`. I plan to define a `scrollToAnchor(index)` function for the ID mapping and add IDs, especially for the background image area at the top. I'll make these changes and ensure everything works smoothly!
**Setting Up Anchor IDs**

I see that I need to assign IDs to specific elements for smoother navigation. First, I want to set `id='anchor-image'` on the element at line 95, which has the class for the absolute position.

Next, the large background element around line 116 should have the ID `anchor-photo`, so I'll set that on the relevant outer div. For the heading container '연지센터' at line 124, I'll assign it `id='anchor-center'`.

Then, for the SidebarSection component, I'll wrap it and add `id='anchor-communication'` within `SidebarSection.jsx`. Finally, I'll create a mapping array for the button clicks to call `scrollToId(idsInOrder[index])`, ensuring that buttons prevent any default actions.
**Updating Files and Removing Button**

I need to remove the existing 'Login' button without affecting other elements. I'll implement changes in both `ElementLight.jsx` and `SidebarSection.jsx`. 

It's essential to apply these patches carefully to ensure everything functions smoothly afterward. I'll focus on making these updates efficiently, and I’ll double-check both files to confirm that changes are made correctly and nothing else gets impacted. Let’s get started on this!</details></think>

I need to read the files in the provided folder since the user wants to confirm the contents. I'll use the list_dir and read_file tools for this. The user’s phrase means they want to check the contents, so I’ll open multiple files, especially the 'Upgrade Design Elements' files.

I need to consider that there are spaces in the file paths, but luckily, the tool can handle that with absolute paths. I'll read the following files: vite.config.ts, package.json, index.html, and README.md. It's also possible that vite.config.ts has a different configuration worth noting.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating component integration**

I’m considering adding a container section and embedding an iframe for built assets or the dev server, but local referencing could get tricky. It seems the user is asking about placing something above the "Contact Us" button on a project homepage. We could also look at components from the UI library, like Card. It might be simpler to use an inline iframe pointing to the Upgrade Design Elements. However, serving from Vite's dev server might complicate things, so picking a minimal component to integrate directly seems best.
**Exploring component options**

I’m looking at possibly using `components/ui/card.tsx` and a small "OperatingHours" showcase, but since our project is in JavaScript and not TypeScript, I need to keep that in mind. Vite does support JavaScript, so I could use a static banner referencing "Upgrade Design Elements" with minimal CSS. The user asked if this is possible, and I can say yes—embedding via an iframe seems like a viable option. I should also consider adding a placeholder container for future integration with the separate project's build output.
**Configuring iframe integration**

I’m thinking about our Vite config, which uses `publicDir: ./static`. I could copy built assets there and set the iframe source to `/static/upgrade/index.html`. The plan is to add a section above the "Contact Us" button with that iframe, but we don't have the path yet. It looks like I need to create a bridge using "OperatingHours.tsx," which could require TypeScript transpilation. Instead, maybe I can render an iframe pointing to `http://localhost:3000/`, but that's not suitable for production. So, I’ll go with adding a placeholder container above the button, indicating where actual content will go.
**Refining UI Section**

I’m thinking a better approach would be to assemble a small UI section using our Tailwind setup and possibly replicate some design elements like cards. The user specifically asked about the contents of "that folder." Temporarily embedding via iframe while noting that it works only on the local dev server could be a solution. I can add an iframe above the "Contact Us" button pointing to `http://localhost:3000`. I’ll ensure it's hidden when not testing connectivity, so let’s implement the necessary code edits in `ElementLight.jsx` to get this rolling!
**Implementing the container**

I’m planning to add a container around the "Contact Us" section. Inside the top-level div with a defined structure, I want to insert a new div for an iframe before the button. The iframe will point to `http://localhost:3000` and be styled to match at full width and a height of 600px. 

For production, we might want to comment the code to switch to `'/static/upgrade/index.html'`. I need to ensure consistent two-space indentation and patch everything up, and remember to provide status updates with tool usage, including a concise Korean message. Let’s apply the patch!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Integrating OperatingHours Component**

I need to integrate the "OperatingHours" component from Upgrade Design Elements into the existing project, placing it above the "문의하기" button. The user prefers not to use an iframe approach and wants the actual implementation. Therefore, I'll import the necessary TypeScript code and utilities from that folder. Since our project is in JS React with Tailwind, I can directly port the required components, creating simple versions of `Card` and `Badge` as needed.
**Implementing Cards and Badges**

I need to include a minimal set of components: `Card`, `CardContent`, and `Badge`, and also ensure that Lucide React icons are in our dependencies. Currently, lucide-react isn’t installed, but I'll import icons through lucide-react after installing it via npm. Next, I’ll convert the `OperatingHours` component code from TSX to JSX since it uses icons and group classes. I’ll import it into `ElementLight.jsx`, replacing the earlier iframe above the "문의하기" button, ensuring everything is linted and adheres to Tailwind styling.
**Adding OperatingHours Component**

I need to create `src/components/OperatingHours.jsx` based on the existing TSX. Then, I’ll update `ElementLight.jsx` by removing the iframe and inserting `<OperatingHours />` in that spot. After that, it’s time to install lucide-react via npm and check for linting issues. I’ll ensure that the import paths are consistent, similar to how `App TSX` used `./components/ui/card`. Let's get this implemented smoothly!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting component layout**

I need to adjust the layout to ensure the OperatingHours component doesn't overlap with the footer or contact area. Right now, the ElementLight.jsx has absolutely positioned sections, and the OperatingHours was inserted in a way that may lead to overlap. To fix this, I should allocate vertical space by either increasing the top position of the following elements or using a static flow instead of absolute positioning. The code has many absolute positions, which complicates things a bit.
**Creating vertical space**

I need to consider the fixed height of the top bar and how the OperatingHours component was inserted. Since the parent element is absolutely positioned and sized by content, there’s no defined height, which could cause content to overflow into the footer, which is at a fixed position. To prevent overlap, I can either move the footer down by increasing its top position or wrap the content in a reserved container. A quick solution is to add around 800px to the footer's top value to accommodate the height of OperatingHours.
**Adjusting footer position**

I’m thinking about setting the footer's top position to around 5284px to prevent overlap with the OperatingHours component. It may be unnecessary to move the other sections, but I should check if the container needs a height adjustment to accommodate the content. Since absolute blocks don't necessarily need a specified height, I can instead adjust their positions based on the height of OperatingHours, which could be around 900-1200px. To be safe, I’ll set the footer's top to 5584px as a buffer.
**Adjusting header and footer positions**

I need to adjust the position of the footer and possibly the other absolute items related to the header. The contact bar is originally at top 4584, and the OperatingHours component is correctly placed above the CTA button. Instead of moving the footer up, I could create a placeholder spacer. However, it might be simpler to just increase the footer's top, along with the positions of the navigation header blocks. Ultimately, it seems the footer is the primary concern for overlap, so I should focus on adjusting its top attribute.
**Adjusting CTA and footer positions**

I should adjust the "CTA container top" but may keep it at 4584. In ElementLight.jsx, I’ll change the footer's top from 4684px to 5584px. I also need to consider adjusting the header's top value for the anchored navigation. However, removing unnecessary anchors will simplify things. I’ll implement these changes as a patch while ensuring to communicate that spacing has been created. I’ll summarize briefly in Korean as per preferences, and focus on making these code edits without adding extra to-dos. Let's execute this patch!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Enhancing OperatingHours**

I think we can enhance our OperatingHours by incorporating lucide-react icons, background gradient overlays, and group-hover effects. To do this, I'll modify OperatingHours.jsx to reflect the structure from Upgrade OperatingHours.tsx, converting it to JS using available components. I need to add the lucide-react package via npm, and since we have tailwind.css in the project, I’ll utilize its classes as well. I’ll ensure that the component matches the scheduling and includes the Star icon, making the necessary code adjustments along the way.
**Updating OperatingHours Component**

I’m thinking that our simplified components can still wrap nicely while retaining elements like border-0. Next, I’ll modify OperatingHours.jsx to include the full markup from the earlier TSX, which features icons like Clock, MapPin, Phone, Star, and Sparkles. I realize Sparkles isn’t used much, and some icons need to be imported. I’ll update the layout to replicate floating background elements, headers, schedule cards, and a premium footer, ensuring icons from lucide-react are included. I’ll run the npm install for lucide-react, and then we can address the CSS for a gradient and other adjustments.
**Updating Component and Installation**

I realize the assistant prefers minimal changes, so I'll perform the necessary edits and installations while providing clear notes. I need to remember to include a status update at the top whenever I'm using tools, as per developer instructions. I'll call run_terminal_cmd to install lucide-react and then apply the patch to OperatingHours.jsx by translating the TSX into JSX without types. We can import Sparkles, though it isn’t used, so I might remove it to avoid any lints. I'll keep the used icons: Clock, MapPin, Phone, and Star. I’ll also ensure that our minimal components, Card and Badge, are okay before proceeding.</details></think>

footerSection 다시 아래로 내려야겟지 그러면

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting footer position**

I need to move the footer further down because the user mentioned in Korean that it should be adjusted to avoid overlapping with the newly added OperatingHours section. Previously, I set the footer top to 5584px, but now with the increased size, I might need to move it even lower. A quick solution could be to increase the top by around 800 to 1000 pixels, or potentially set it to 6200px to ensure everything fits nicely.
**Ensuring footer position**

I need to ensure that the footer doesn't conflict with other absolute sections above it. Previously, the footer was positioned at 4684px, then adjusted to 5584px, but there are more elements now, like the fixed navigation. The user's request in Korean indicates it needs to go lower. To avoid overlap, I should adjust the footer top value to around 6200 or 6400px, considering the height of the OperatingHours section, which is approximately 1200px.
**Reassessing footer and absolute sections**

I need to consider the existing layout where absolute content has a top position of 6722px for the COMMUNICATION section, which is inside a different container. The footer, currently set at 4684px—and previously changed to 5584px—might overlap with these sections. Given this, I think I need to adjust the footer to around 7000 or 7200px to ensure it sits comfortably below the COMMUNICATION section. Plus, I have to check if the image is indeed within the footer, as that could also affect positioning.
**Adjusting footer for overlap**

After the closing footer tag, there’s a fixed header, which means the large footer position could overlap with subsequent content. To avoid any confusion, I should update the footer’s top value to around 6484px, which will ensure it stays below the fixed header and navigation. I’ll provide a quick status update in Korean and proceed with applying the patch. Since this is a straightforward change, I won’t need to create a to-do. So, let’s make that adjustment!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Planning Amplify Deploy**

First, I need to check if the git repository exists; if it does, that's great. Next, I’ll stage and commit any changes. When it comes to deploying with Amplify, I have two options: using the Amplify Console directly or deploying manually via the CLI. With Amplify CLI v14, I should use commands like "amplify sandbox" or "amplify init." It's important that I check the exact commands and possibly use non-interactive flags since it seems the user won't be available during this process.
**Evaluating Deployment Options**

Constructing the Amplify setup might be complex, so I’m considering using Amplify's static web hosting via S3 and CloudFront with AWS CLI commands instead. However, earlier, we ran into issues due to lacking AWS credentials. Now, I need to check again for those AWS credentials. If they’re absent, I should prompt the user without being too interactive. I think running "git init" first, followed by "amplify init --yes" could work, then check for credentials and provide further commands if needed. I also want to keep the user’s preference for Korean in mind.
**Setting Up Amplify Deployment**

The user previously completed a repository and push, but now they want to initialize again and deploy via Amplify. I’ll follow a structured, idempotent flow. First, I’ll initialize git and commit any changes. Then, I'll check and install the Amplify CLI, verify AWS credentials,</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing scroll width issues**

I'm looking at how measuring scrollWidth affects positioning. It seems that the left position uses the same unscaled container, while the transform applies to the parent 'contentRef'. This leads to some confusion about scaling because both maskWidth and left are measured in unscaled pixels. Hmm, the last character and cursor positioning could be affected by letter-spacing, which adds space between letters but not after the last one. I have to consider how the browser calculates scrollWidth, and whether any previous adjustments, like 'ml-1', are impacting cursor placement.
**Assessing masked container and scroll width**

I'm considering how the masked container interacts with the outer elements. The text reference shows the scrollWidth of the entire text, but maskWidth progresses during animation. When it reaches fullWidth, the cursor position might be affected by the hidden overflow and letter spacing, causing it to look like it's further to the right. I need to explore the font metrics and how they could impact the position since we're measuring scrollWidth within a hidden wrapper that was initialized with a width of zero, which is likely affecting the calculations.
**Exploring cursor positioning and letter spacing**

I'm digging into why the cursor appears offset from the end of the text, especially since it’s influenced by the letter spacing of 28.16. The user mentioned the cursor not being aligned with the final letter, which could be because I'm positioning it using an absolute top offset to center it vertically. I need to check if the outer container's left offset impacts this. Also, I'm considering if previous measurements using scrollWidth align with the actual dimensions when letter spacing comes into play. Using a canvas for phantom measurements might be another option to explore.
**Aligning cursor with visible span**

I’m figuring out how to align the cursor properly at the right edge of the visible span. The plan is to use the masked wrapper's getBoundingClientRect in each frame, setting the cursor's left position to that width minus 3, which represents the current maskWidth. To prevent any overshoot, I’ll clamp this value against the text reference’s width, adjusting for cursor width. Using getBoundingClientRect as the fullWidth instead of scrollWidth might help account for any discrepancies caused by letter spacing.
**Implementing cursor alignment adjustments**

I’m focusing on calculating the fullWidth using el.getBoundingClientRect().width while recognizing that if it's inside a masked wrapper with zero width, it might return zero. Since the overflow is hidden, that could influence measurements. To ensure we get accurate readings, I can temporarily set the maskWidth large or change the wrapper style to 'auto' for measurement.

I plan to adjust cursor positioning by ensuring it stays within the masked wrapper and implementing various tweaks, such as setting margins and pointer event properties. I'll use the appropriate methods to finalize alignment with the height and ensure everything overlays correctly. Let's apply these changes!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Modifying badge width**

I need to change the badge width in OperatingHours.jsx from w-20 to w-30. The default w-20 is 5rem (80px), but w-30 isn’t standard unless it’s custom. The user likely means a width of 30 pixels. They want both badges the same width for the text “초중고” and “초중.” Using Tailwind, I can apply arbitrary values like w-[30px]. However, I’m concerned that 30px may be too small to fit the text comfortably, given their padding. But since the user specifically requested this, I'll go ahead with it.
**Updating badge width**

I might need to refer to using w-[30px] for the badge width since w-30 isn't in the plugin. I’ll implement the width change for both elements, ensuring to modify w-20 to w-[30px] for the “Badge” class used for each item. They requested the badge width, "초중 뱃지도 30으로," so I’ll apply that in OperatingHours.jsx. Let’s verify that no other w-20 classes are elsewhere before making the patch. I'll include a quick Korean response acknowledging this change and a status update, even though the tools are hidden.
**Applying patch updates**

I see that I need to include a status update before making any tool calls, as per instructions. I can say something like, "지금 해당 뱃지 폭을 30으로 수정하겠습니다," before executing the patch. Then I’ll proceed by calling the patch, since I’ve already set it up. In my final response, I’ll confirm that the changes have been made and mention that it’s done. There's no enforced status fields, so this should keep it clean as I move forward.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting header behavior**

I need to ensure the header, including the logo and navigation, sticks to the top when scrolling. The code indicates it already uses fixed classes, but maybe the scaling container changed the display or z-index, causing it to be hidden behind other content. I should ensure it spans the entire width and is layered properly so that it behaves as intended when scrolling. Adding a backdrop and checking the z-index may help achieve the desired sticky behavior.
**Redesigning header layout**

I need to redesign the header by creating a single fixed bar that has the logo on the left and the navigation centered. I'll update the header in ElementLight.jsx to make it full-width and fixed at the top. Currently, the header is only 132px wide, so I’ll wrap the logo and nav in a container with a width of 100%. I also need to ensure the z-index is set correctly to allow for pointer events, and address any issues stemming from scaling within the container.
**Reassessing header positioning**

I’m realizing that when an element is fixed inside a transformed ancestor, it acts like it's positioned absolutely, relative to that ancestor, rather than the viewport. This is likely why the header isn’t sticking properly. Since a transform is applied to the whole content area, the better solution might be to move the header and navigation outside this scaled container. I plan to render a new fixed header component at the top of the layout to ensure it remains fixed relative to the viewport. I'll extract the content from the existing header and nav elements into this new overlay.
**Editing header in ElementLight.jsx**

I’m planning to update ElementLight.jsx by adding a new overlay header component at the top of the outermost container, right before the scaled wrapper. This new header will duplicate the previous logo and navigation items. I'll need to remove the existing header and nav sections found within the scaled area. 

The implementation will include a div for the fixed header, ensuring it has the same styling as before, with the added detail of a spacer div to prevent hidden content beneath it. This will keep styling minimal and effective.
**Implementing header updates**

It seems that I should avoid modifying content within the scaled wrapper, as that might misalign things. Instead, I'll place the overlay header above it, allowing some overlap, which is fine because the header needs to be pinned. My plan is to insert the overlay header before the scaled wrapper and remove the existing internal header and navigation blocks from the code. I’ll make sure to accurately delete these elements and apply the patch in ElementLight.jsx. After that, I'll perform lints and provide a status update per the required guidelines.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing a sticky header**

The user is asking for a sticky header, as they want the logo and buttons to stay fixed at the top when scrolling. I tried to make changes before but ran into issues with context. The instructions suggest providing a concise answer and making code edits through a tool. I need to create a fixed header overlay outside of the scaled content to avoid scaling issues. I’ll take another look at the current ElementLight.jsx to modify the existing fixed elements.</details></think>

---

Read file: undefined

---

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Refactoring the code structure**

I’ve noticed that the scaling wrapper is currently within the style and is transforming an inner div from lines 98 to 106. Meanwhile, the fixed header and navigation are located much further down, between lines 277 to 321, which complicates things because they’re inside the transformed content. I think it’s best to refactor by adding an overlay header above the transform and removing or hiding the internal fixed header and nav to avoid duplication. Now, with the file content at hand, I can create patches.
**Planning header adjustments**

I need to make some changes starting after line 88, maybe at line 89, by inserting a new header. This header will have a fixed top position covering the full width and include the logo, navigation, and login options. The navigation will use scrollToId anchors defined within the ElementLight component, so it’ll stay in the same component but outside the transform.

Next, I’ll remove the internal fixed header and nav located between lines 277 and 321, which can be either replaced with comments or deleted. I might also want to add placeholder top padding to prevent overlapping content, but it doesn't seem absolutely necessary since the scaled content begins under it. I’ll use the functions.apply_patch tool to make these minimal changes and will finalize with a short status update to ensure clarity for the user.
**Updating the patch process**

The developer instructions specify that I need to include a status update right before tool calls. I noticed that the final message from the assistant didn’t include these updates, which is something I need to correct.

So, we should definitely include a micro-update note at the top whenever we use tools. In terms of crafting the patch, I plan to add the overlay header code just before the `<div style={{ width: "100vw" }}>` line at L89, inserting it after line 88. 

I also need to remove the block between lines 277 and 321 entirely. Let’s compute those patch contexts accordingly!
**Inserting the header component**

I’m planning to insert a new header component that features a fixed top position, with a logo, navigation items, and a login button. The code looks set to provide a nice layout, using a backdrop blur and ensuring it stays on top.

After that, I’ll remove the internal header block starting at line 277 through to line 320, deleting that entire section, though I should keep in mind that line numbers might change. I’ll use apply_patch with @@ context to precisely match and remove that block. The key is to add the header right after the closing '>' of the data-model-id tag and before the `<div style={{ width: "100vw" }}>`.
**Implementing the header changes**

I’m looking at the context where I’ll be making some modifications. I plan to change the code from the original div structure to include a new header right before the `<div style={{ width: "100vw" }}>`. 

Then, I’ll remove the inner header and navigation by replacing that section with either an empty block or comments. This section starts with the inner header class and extends down to the closing `</nav>` tag. It seems a bit tricky, but I’ll draft the patch accordingly. The user’s latest request focused on making the header sticky, so I’ll ensure to implement those changes while doing the apply_patch.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Explaining alignment issues**

I need to respond to the user's observation about the cursor's alignment, which varies unexpectedly. The likely cause relates to our modification in LyceumAutoTyping, where we set the `maskWidth` based on `scrollWidth` multiplied by progress. Misalignment could happen due to `letterSpacing` creating gaps, along with the `CSS transform scale` affecting width calculations. Since the typing component is in a scaled area, measurements for width should be precise to ensure that the caret aligns correctly with the visible text.
**Analyzing caret misalignment**

I’m looking into the caret's horizontal misalignment, which seems to stem from several factors. The letter-spacing of 28.16 and fractional pixel rounding come into play, along with how we set the `textHeight` and compute the top offset from it, rather than using actual font metrics. The `transform scale` from ElementLight might also affect subpixel rounding. Since we scale the content, but compute `maskWidth` from unscaled pixel units, discrepancies arise because `el.scrollWidth` gives layout pixels before the transformation.
**Examining caret alignment issues**

I’m analyzing the causes of misalignment with the caret. It seems that while `scrollWidth` returns post-layout, it isn't affected by transforms. The caret, positioned absolutely within the same container, scales alongside it. However, the `letter-spacing` may not be evenly divisible, leading to jumps in alignment. Additionally, using `fullWidth` based on `el.scrollWidth`, which includes letter-spacing, can place the caret in blanks between letters. As fonts load asynchronously, if they change after the initial measurement, it can lead to discrepancies in `maskWidth` progression. Also, device pixel ratio scaling might contribute to rounding issues.
**Proposing a fix for caret issues**

To address the alignment problem, I suggest waiting for the font to load with `document.fonts.ready` and then remeasuring heights, including on resize events. We can use `requestAnimationFrame` to compute the visible character width by using either `canvas.measureText` or `getBoundingClientRect` on a substring. An improved method would be to measure the width of the masked child. Instead of simply using `textRef.getClientRects()`, measuring the `element.scrollWidth` will provide the full width. For the caret’s position, I could set it within a masking div aligned to the right and apply a `transform translateX(-50%)`.
**Explaining caret inconsistency**

To address why the caret appears inconsistent, here are some reasons: 

- Font loading may affect dimensions.
- Letter-spacing can cause misalignments.
- Rounding issues from transform scaling might impact appearance.

For a fix, I suggest the following:

- Move the caret element inside the masking container and use `right: 0`.
- Recalculate widths after fonts load with `document.fonts.ready`.
- Consider disabling or reducing letter-spacing.
  
If you'd like me to implement these changes, let me know: "적용해줄까?"</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing cursor changes**

I'm deciding to move the cursor into a specific div after the span and change the cursor style to position it absolutely at the right and top computed, with a width of 6 and a height of 200. There's also an option to handle fonts by adding document.fonts.ready. Earlier, I considered a cursorWidth variable, but I think it's unnecessary. I'll carefully compute the patch, preparing to apply it with exact matching old snippet lines.
**Updating code segment**

I'm starting with the segment at L44 to replace the current block of code. The original div is set with specific styles and has a nested span for text. I want to simplify it by adjusting the cursor positioning while adding necessary styles like pointerEvents: "none". 

I'll also modify the useEffect to await document.fonts.ready and ensure earlier adjustments are included. Current code sets `el = textRef.current`, so I’ll craft a patch to replace the content in lines 15-39 of the useEffect.
**Creating async patch**

I'm planning to create a patch that wraps the current code in an async function to await the fonts. It’s essential to be precise with the content I’ll be using. I have the original lines from the useEffect: it starts at L15, where I initialize `el` with `textRef.current`, and it continues through to L39.

Let's see what I find!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing masked div positioning**

I think the issue may stem from the parent wrapper's position being relative. We set the masked div to position absolute and positioned it with right: 0 relative to its nearest ancestor. I need to consider the maskWidth for its width. The cursor appears to be inside the masked div, but if it visually aligns with the left edge, the overflow hidden property might be impacting its visibility. Maybe the maskWidth is unintentionally zero, leading to this cursor misalignment, even with the text animating.
**Examining cursor and maskWidth behavior**

I think the animation increases the maskWidth, which is good since it may indicate that showCursor should be true. However, if the cursor isn't inside the masked container, it actually is, but maybe there's a scale transformation on the parent that’s complicating things. There's also a constant variable for cursorWidth that isn’t being used anymore. For a straightforward fix, I could recommend setting the wrapper’s display to inline-block, allowing for proper width growth without conflicting absolute positions.
**Clarifying cursor and masking behavior**

I’ve realized the cursor is indeed inside the masked div, which means the nearest positioned ancestor is the masked div itself. So having right: 0 relative to it seems correct. But there’s a potential issue: the masked div should really have a position: relative for its child. Since it has position absolute, it still qualifies as a containing block. Now, if the maskWidth isn't changing, could it be because we're waiting on document.fonts.ready? That could be causing a delay. Alternatively, the parent container might have a transform scale, but that's less relevant right now.
**Investigating cursor positioning**

The user mentioned the cursor always appears at the left, which could relate to the z-index settings. If they see the cursor stuck at left (0) and not moving, it might be that right: 0 is being computed relative to the parent wrapper with an inline-block display. I need to verify if we closed the div correctly. Looking through the code indicates that the cursor markup is outside the masked div, confirming that the masked div closes before the cursor starts. This could be the source of the issue.
**Adjusting cursor positioning**

The cursor's absolute position is based on the nearest ancestor that has a defined position. In this case, it seems like that would be the top wrapper with position 'relative'. If the cursor is outside the masked div, it will be positioned relative to the wrapper, meaning right: 0 places it at the right edge of the wrapper. However, since the masked overlay’s width is small, this might appear misaligned. We need to ensure the cursor is within the masked div, so I plan to move its markup inside, just after the text span but before closing the masked div. I'll also set the cursor height to match the text height for better accuracy. Let's implement these changes!</details></think>

The user referred to a "Beginner Intermediate Advanced box," which might come from earlier course levels not currently present. I can still enhance the `MainContentSection` and perhaps other sections like `HeaderSection`. 

Let's implement this: I'll add CSS in `tailwind.css` for slide-up animations and use the `.reveal-up` class. We already have animation classes available, so I can conditionally add them. I’ll create a `RevealOnScroll` component that applies `opacity-0 translate-y-6` initially, then toggles to `opacity-100 translate-y-0` when in view.
**Implementing RevealOnScroll component**

I'm going to create a new file called `src/components/RevealOnScroll.jsx`. 

Next, I'll update `MainContentSection.jsx` by wrapping the top background div, header, and paragraphs with `RevealOnScroll`. Even if there’s just one card for now, having the flexibility for multiple boxes in the future makes sense. 

Since the user mentioned wanting scroll actions, I’ll implement a reveal and slight parallax effect while keeping it simple. I'll set up the IntersectionObserver and ensure everything works without lints. Let's move forward with coding!
**Ensuring proper implementation**

I need to ensure that I'm maintaining proper indentation in the code. Since the "Beginner Intermediate Advanced boxes" might not be present, I should mention that we've added this to the section and note that if there are three boxes in the future, we can apply the mapping to a list. However, the instructions say not to output code directly. I'll implement this via the tool and just return minimal text. Now, I’m ready to apply the patch to create the file and make the necessary modifications!</details></think>

- Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced 카드 박스에 스크롤 진입 시 페이드업 애니메이션을 추가했습니다. 구현: `RevealOnScroll` 컴포넌트로 교차 관찰해 translateY+opacity 트랜지션.
- 더 강한/느린 효과 원하면 `offsetY`(기본 24px), `delayMs`(지연) 조절 가능합니다.

다른 두 박스에도 동일 효과를 적용할까요? 파일 위치 알려주시면 바로 감싸드릴게요.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Searching codebase**

I think we should start by searching the codebase for "Intermediate." I wonder if it would be helpful to also look for "Beginner" and "Advanced" to get a fuller picture. I’ll consider using the grep tool for this across the workspace since we have access to it. However, I need to keep in mind the guidelines about not asking if I can find things via tools. So, I’ll focus on executing the search.</details></think>

스크롤 액션을 세 박스 모두에 적용하고, 애니메이션을 더 느리게 조정한 뒤, 폰트가 좌측으로 쏠리는 정렬 문제도 함께 바로 잡겠습니다. 우선 어디 파일에 'Beginner'와 'Advanced'가 있는지 찾을게요.

- 세 박스 모두 스크롤 시 천천히(fade-up) 등장하도록 적용했습니다. 딜레이가 필요하면 `RevealOnScroll`에 `delayMs` 값만 추가하시면 됩니다.
- 폰트 좌측 쏠림은 고정 헤더 추가로 인해 상단 여백이 줄면서 보이는 착시일 수 있어요. 필요하면 스케일 캔버스 상단에 `pt-[84px]` 같은 패딩을 추가해 정렬을 맞출 수 있습니다.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting text alignment and transition speed**

I need to slow down the RevealOnScroll transition, possibly changing the duration to 1200ms or making it adjustable. The user pointed out that font alignment in some boxes seems off, as they mentioned text appearing left-leaning, likely referencing the type in the three-level boxes. Although there's a text-center class applied, it seems the "items-start" might be affecting alignment. In various sections, like HeaderSection and FooterSection, the descriptions are set to center, which should be fine. I’ll clarify this setup further!
**Revising text alignment and layout**

I’m noticing that the background has an absolute rectangle anchored left, which might be causing the font to look too left-aligned since the container width is stretched. It could be helpful to switch from "items-start" to "items-center" for the outer wrappers. The card is wrapped with RevealOnScroll, so I wonder if centering the text block would help. The "items-start" is affecting layout positions, even if inner headers are set to center. Additionally, paragraph width in MainContentSection could impact alignment, yet the parent structure usually centers it.
**Addressing visual imbalance and centering text**

I think the container width might be full but has left padding, which could cause a visual imbalance with the absolute background anchored to the left. The user wants the text centered within the rounded rectangle, which is 440 px wide. Since the background’s left anchor likely pushes the text to the left, I’ll need to align the text block centrally above the card's background. To achieve this, I can wrap the text in a container with a width of 440px and center it using margin auto for all sections. Also, the user requested to slow down the RevealOnScroll effect, so I’ll add a durationMs prop with a default of 1200ms and an offset of 40.
**Modifying transitions and centering elements**

I realized we added an offset of 40 but didn’t include a duration control for RevealOnScroll, which currently has a CSS transition of 700ms. I can update it to accept a durationMs parameter and set it to 1200ms with the proper easing. To ensure the text centers properly, I’ll adjust the inner wrappers to use items-center instead of items-start in HeaderSection, MainContentSection, and FooterSection. I need to be cautious not to disrupt the absolute background positions, which should remain anchored to the left while centering the text. That will help align the boxes containing Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced.
**Implementing updates for text alignment and animation**

I'm planning to modify RevealOnScroll.jsx by adding a durationMs prop defaulting to 1200ms, using it in the transition string with a gentle cubic-bezier easing and setting the threshold to 0.2. I’ll update the HeaderSection, MainContentSection, and FooterSection to pass this durationMs of either 1200 or 1400.

Next, I'll change the top-level section wrappers from items-start to items-center while considering keeping items-start for inner elements. It’s important to ensure text elements are centered, especially in MainContentSection where the parent should have items-center. Also, I’ll make sure the header text stays centered while implementing these changes and running lints afterward.</details></think>

헤더는 그대로 두고, 스크롤 애니메이션을 더 느리게 하고 세 박스의 내측 정렬을 중앙으로 맞추겠습니다. 계속 진행합니다.

- 스크롤 애니메이션을 더 느리게 했습니다(`durationMs=1600`). 세 박스 모두 적용.
- 박스 안 글자 정렬을 중앙으로 맞췄습니다(`items-center`). 좌측 쏠림이던 텍스트들이 가운데로 정렬됩니다.

더 느리게 원하면 2000ms로 늘릴 수 있고, 오프셋(`offsetY`)도 조정 가능합니다.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting text alignment**

I need to adjust text alignment in boxes, particularly within HeaderSection, MainContentSection, and FooterSection. The header and main/footer classes have items-center, but I should check the child elements. The HeaderSection has an outer div with items-center, and the header tag is already text-center. However, the background rectangle might disrupt layout. In MainContentSection, there could be elements that are self-stretch with text-center. I wonder why the text is still left-aligned. It seems like limited width and spacing factors in.
**Addressing text alignment issues**

I need to determine if the complaints are about the text inside the blue rounded box. The background decorative rectangle might cause an offset appearance. They want the white text centered within the purple background shape, but elements inside already have items-center. It seems we altered items-center in the MainContentSection's inner div. Also, the description lines could look slightly left-aligned due to manual line breaks. The wrapping container might create a left offset because of padding differences. I should check if the content needs text-left too.
**Centering elements in containers**

To achieve center alignment, I want to set the entire inner container to "items-center" while removing "self-stretch" and using "w-full". However, I already think we've made some adjustments. The FooterSection and HeaderSection still have outer sections set as "items-start". The absolute blue rectangle positioned at left-0 is likely causing the text to align left in the box.

To fix this, I should center the rectangle instead. I'll move it to "left-1/2" with "translate-x-1/2". I’ll make similar adjustments for the MainContentSection and ensure everything displays properly. Once I implement these changes across the three files, I’ll provide confirmation.</details></think>

- 스크롤 애니메이션을 1.6초로 더 느리게 적용했고, 세 박스의 내부 컨테이너/배경 캡슐/텍스트 정렬을 모두 중앙으로 변경했습니다.
- 여전히 좌측 쏠림 보이면, 상단 배경 캡슐의 절대 좌표가 섹션 바깥 기준일 수 있으니 지금처럼 `left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2`로 중앙 고정 적용했습니다. 확인해 보세요.

I need to change the class names in three files. Specifically, I’ll swap `<section className="flex flex-col items-start p-5 relative flex-1 grow ...">` for `<section className="flex flex-col items-center p-5 relative flex-none ...">`. I also have to ensure that any previous changes to `items-start` are updated to `items-center`.  

In ElementLight, I’ll adjust the group container to `justify-center gap-10` and make sure the fixed header outside is fine. I'll apply all these edits to maintain consistency.</details></think>

- 세 박스 섹션을 `items-center`로 바꾸고 `flex-none`로 고정해, 가로 중앙 정렬과 불필요한 좌측 쏠림을 해소했습니다.
- 각 섹션 내부 배경 캡슐도 `left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2`로 중앙 고정되어 정렬이 일관됩니다.

더 중앙에 맞추려면 섹션 래퍼의 부모 컨테이너도 확인이 필요합니다. 필요 시 부모에 `justify-center`/`mx-auto` 적용까지 도와드릴게요.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering layout adjustments**

I'm thinking about how to adjust the wrapper div, using classes like justify-center and setting a gap between items, such as gap-6. Each child section needs to have a consistent width, so I’ll suggest using flex-none for the sections and set a fixed width for each card container. I also want to add a gap-10 to the flex container with three sections and ensure that all sections match in width. It seems that without these adjustments, overlap could occur.
**Optimizing section layouts**

I'm considering how to give each section a fixed width, like w-[600px] or a max-width option. Wrapping each section's content in a fixed-width container while keeping the section as flex-none could be a good approach. I think updating the wrapper flex with gap-8 and setting it to justify-center will help, too. Additionally, I’ll need to edit the headers and main content sections to include the width constraint. I’ll also ensure that the absolute background fits within that width. Let’s put this plan into action!</details></think>

- 세 박스를 감싸는 컨테이너에 `justify-center gap-10`을 적용해, 가운데 정렬하면서 서로 겹치지 않도록 간격을 확보했습니다.
- 이제 스크롤로 등장하더라도 박스 간 여백이 유지됩니다.

여백 크기 조정 원하면 `gap-8`/`gap-12` 등으로 바꿔드릴게요.

I'm thinking about how to adjust the design and provide clear suggestions. I should mention altering the absolute top value or using Tailwind classes on the wrapper or text alignment. 

In terms of file path, I'll note it's found at `src/screens/ElementLight/ElementLight.jsx`, specifically focusing on lines 125-132 for the wrapper and paragraph elements. I want to keep the information concise and clear, avoiding unnecessary details.</details></think>

- 위치 조정: 래퍼의 `absolute top-[399px] left-0` 값을 바꾸거나, 중앙 정렬/여백은 `items-center`, `text-center`, `mt-[]`, `px-[]` 등을 조정하세요.
