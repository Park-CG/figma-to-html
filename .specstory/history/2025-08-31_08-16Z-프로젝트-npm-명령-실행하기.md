<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Running the dev server**

I'm planning to run `npm run dev`, and the dev server will use port 5173. Since this is a long-running command, I need to execute it in the background and provide status updates. After executing, I'll share the logs from the command, including a brief update. I should also mention that `http://localhost:5173` will be the link to access it. There's no need for a detailed todo list here since it's a straightforward task with just a couple of steps.
**Planning parallel tool calls**

I'm thinking we should read `package.json` and `vite.config.js` in parallel, and then run `npm run dev`. But first, I need to make sure dependencies are installed, so I'll run `npm ci` since the package-lock exists. For tools requiring interaction, I'll remember to pass non-interactive flags if needed, but it seems unnecessary here. My plan is to check the scripts, install, and then run the dev server. After that, I need to run it in the background efficiently.
**Considering the dev server setup**

I see that the guidelines mention using `| cat` for pagers, but since the dev server is a long-running process, I plan to run it in the background. There's a possibility that port 5173 might already be in use, but I guess we can just run it and check. It's noted that I should prefer running tools automatically, so I’m set to proceed with the plan. Let's move forward and see how it goes!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Executing commands for setup**

The system mentions some command syntax, but that's not relevant here. I should execute two commands: "npm install" followed by "npm run dev -- --host" which might help expose the address. For running the dev server, I need the background job flag as true. I can run multiple terminal commands sequentially since install must finish before dev. I should include status updates before and after each call and mention how to open the server in the browser, likely at http://localhost:5173.
**Checking Node compatibility**

I need to ensure that Node version is compatible with Vite 6, which requires Node 18 or higher. The machine probably has Node, but I can’t be sure. I could check by running 'node -v', but it’s not strictly necessary, just helpful for preflight. The instructions suggest running non-interactive commands. First, I’ll execute 'npm install' in the project directory after changing into /Users/parkcg/Downloads/figma-to-html, which should be the correct working directory since it initializes at the project root by default.
**Running commands safely**

To be extra careful, I’ll prefix my command with 'cd ... && npm install' to ensure I'm in the right directory. The tool advises that I should change to the correct directory if I'm in a new shell, so I'll use 'cd /Users/parkcg/Downloads/figma-to-html && npm install'. Next, I’ll run 'npm run dev'. To keep it non-interactive, I might consider adding '--open=false', but it’s not strictly necessary. I’ll capture the output of 'npm install' and handle any errors related to Node or permissions if they arise.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Testing local server status**

I’m considering running a quick check on the server status instead of using npx or web_search. I think I can execute a command like 'sleep 2; curl -sI localhost:5173' to verify if the server's up. I could also create a small loop to probe ports between 5173 and 5180.

I might run a command to print the first accessible port, and it could be important to check if Vite prints the local network link. I’ll also ensure the Node.js versions are okay.
**Preparing tool usage**

I need to ensure we have a status update included before each tool batch, which I've already done. Since the user prefers responses in Korean, I need to keep that in mind. I’ll use the 'teacher_inquiry' label for any descriptive Korean answers, but here I'm focused on direct action.

I know we’ve used various tools, so including small updates is essential. Now, let’s run the curl check. I might also want to show how to stop the server with 'npm run dev' if needed, but it’s not necessary to do that right now.
**Running port check command**

I’m planning to execute a command that will check specific ports to see if the server is responding correctly. The command looks like this: `bash -lc 'for p in 5173 5174 3000 8080; do if curl -sI "http://localhost:$p" | grep -i \"200\\|vite\" >/dev/null; then echo $p; break; fi; done || echo "NO"'`. 

I think it’s important to ensure that the output is clear and helpful for the user. Let's run this command now!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering Vite server options**

I'm looking at how Vite defaults to port 5173 but missed capturing the address because I piped the logs to avoid a pager. It's clear I need those logs to see the address. Long-running background commands should indeed be run with `is_background` set to true, which I did, but maybe I should tail the output? The tool interface doesn’t let me attach to previous jobs. I might have to start a new instance on a specified port, but that could lead to conflicts.
**Exploring Vite server options**

I could start the dev server again on port 5174 to prevent any conflicts and run it in the background with `npm run dev -- --port 5174 --host`. The Vite script is just "vite," and I can pass arguments after the double dash, which is great. After launching, I should provide the URL, and</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing responsive behavior**

I need to make the web page responsive so it can adjust dynamically to computer sizes. They want specific code changes for a Vite React setup with Tailwind. My first step will be checking the index.html for the viewport meta tag and looking at src/index.jsx for screen components. The request sounds generic but leads me to consider how to adjust container widths, typography, and ensure the root wrapper utilizes responsive CSS with Tailwind classes. I could also set responsive font sizes in a global CSS using Tailwind’s `@layer base`. I'll write down the multi-step tasks to tackle this!
**Planning responsive changes**

I see that I need to make some small but important updates: adding the viewport meta tag if it isn't already there, setting up global responsive typography using CSS clamp, and ensuring the root `div` has a min-h-screen and container with responsive max-width and padding. Before diving into coding, I should check several files like index.html, src/index.jsx, ElementLight.jsx, HeroSection.jsx, ValuesSection.jsx, and tailwind.css. I’ll read these files in parallel to streamline the process.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering responsive design**

I need to ensure the webpage is responsive by adjusting code to match different screen sizes. The current code has fixed widths, like w-[1920px], and absolute positioning. I'll add responsive Tailwind classes and wrap elements in a container with max-width settings. A simpler method might be implementing a "fluid scaling" wrapper that uses CSS transform scaling to fit the viewport width while adjusting height accordingly. I could also explore setting the base font-size using a calculation but fixed pixel classes limit flexibility.
**Implementing responsive scaling**

To effectively convert all widths and positions, I think the easiest route is to create a responsive "scale down to fit" wrapper. I'll wrap the content inside a div, setting its width to 1920px and applying a transform scale based on the viewport width. I'll also adjust the container's height for vertical scrolling.

I plan to implement a React hook that calculates the scale and applies both the transformation and height adjustments. Additionally, I'll add a resize event listener and ensure the meta viewport tag is present. Finally, I'll address the content's height, as it's currently too fixed with values like 6840px.
**Addressing container height**

The base container height is currently 1200, but there’s a lot of absolutely positioned content involved. This leads to an overall height that exceeds 1200. When using the scale wrapper approach, I plan to calculate the content's natural height by using a reference, setting the outer container height accordingly to maintain scrolling functionality.

In `ElementLight.jsx`, I'll wrap the inner content in a scaling container to apply the transformation. I’ll also add a `useEffect` with `useState` to compute the scale based on the window’s width, and maybe even consider height too.
**Scaling for responsiveness**

I typically plan to scale by width to ensure the content matches the viewport width, allowing for vertical scrolling. The design width is set at 1920, and I’ll use a reference to the content to determine the scroll height needed for the outer wrapper's height.

The outer wrapper will have a width of 100vw and a height based on the scaled height. I’ll also establish the transform origin at the top center and adjust the styles accordingly. Additionally, I’ll need to import `useRef` and `useEffect/useState` from React to manage this. Finally, I’ll create a todo list for implementing the code changes effectively.
**Planning implementation steps**

I realize we actually only have one file to work on, so I could skip the todo list, but it helps to track tasks. I’ll create a small todo list with two items: implementing the responsive scaling wrapper and testing on the dev server. 

Next, I’ll edit `ElementLight.jsx` to incorporate the wrapper. The code will include managing the scale based on viewport width, and I plan to avoid scaling up beyond the original design width of 1920 to prevent image blurring. I’ll ensure to use appropriate imports and maintain consistent indentation when making these changes. Finally, I’ll run a build to verify everything compiles correctly.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing responsive design**

I need to make the webpage responsive to different screen widths since the current setup is stuck at a fixed 1920px wide container with absolute positioning. The user asked for code to help dynamically adjust the layout for computer sizes. I should add a wrapper that scales based on viewport width, possibly using a React hook to adjust the scale according to `window.innerWidth` and handle any resizing events. I won’t output the actual code, though; I’ll edit the necessary files directly.
**Wrapping for scaling**

I see there’s already a top-level div with specific classes that can be adjusted. I’m thinking of wrapping the inner div for scaling with a few React hooks like `useEffect`, `useState`, and maybe `useMemo`. This could help compute scale either using CSS with something like `calc(100vw / 1920)` or by assigning a CSS variable through inline styles. However, I’m not entirely sure if using `calc()` directly within the `scale()` function is valid CSS. It's a bit confusing!
**Computing scale via JavaScript**

I’m thinking that using `calc()` in CSS for scaling might not work since it produces dimensioned values. Instead, I believe it’s better to compute the scale using JavaScript directly. I can create a small hook with a constant for the design width and some state for the scale. I’ll also set up a resize event to update this scale dynamically. In the JSX, I’ll wrap the content nicely, using the scale value for transformation, and figure out a dynamic way to handle the height.
**Adjusting for scaling**

I’ve realized that when scaling, the element's bounding box shrinks according to the scale factor. This means I need to adjust the wrapper's height to prevent overflow or ensure proper scrolling. A common solution is to use an extra container with a height based on the layout height multiplied by the scale. However, I’m concerned because our layout height is quite large, with the top-level element using absolute positioning that can reach around 7000px. This could complicate things a bit!
**Refactoring for scaling**

I need to make some adjustments since the current layout isn't working correctly with absolute positioning. The top container has a fixed height that doesn't accommodate the absolutely positioned children, causing them to overflow. To fix this, I’ll set up a wrapper with a calculated height that adapts based on scaling. I plan to create ref elements, manage height within a scaled context, and ensure no scroll issues arise. It’s essential to keep the code minimal, follow indentation styles, and carefully implement necessary updates while avoiding unnecessary restructuring.
**Implementing wrapper structure**

I need to set up the wrapper structure correctly around the scaled content in the `contentRef`. This involves creating a layout that centers the content properly while managing its scaling. I’ll define the `scaledHeight` based on changes in window size and ensure updates with a resize listener and a ResizeObserver to catch any content size changes dynamically. After editing the code, I’ll run the build command to check for any syntax errors and make sure to keep track of TODO statuses as I go. Let's move forward with this plan!</details></think>

I need to make sure the code compiles without issues. I added React imports and a transform scale wrapper. I also have to check for any semantic problems since I removed the outer container that had absolute positioned sections and replaced it with a wrapper affecting the layout. The inner structure has changed; now there's a new container and adjusted divs. I should double-check for any misplaced closure tags to ensure everything is syntactically correct.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering horizontal scrolling**

The user's request indicates they want horizontal scrolling to navigate left-right through content instead of scaling it to the viewport. I think we need to add the CSS property `overflow-x: auto` and possibly disable scaling on smaller screens. The phrase they used suggests this requirement clearly. 

To implement this, I might consider a container with `overflow-x: auto` and a fixed inner width of 1920 while keeping the scale at 1 to ensure horizontal scrolling is enabled.
**Adjusting scaling for scrolling**

I'm considering changing the scaling approach to allow scaling only when it’s greater than 1, but currently, we've set it to a minimum of `min(viewport/DESIGN_WIDTH, 1)`. This means that for a viewport smaller than 1920, scaling will fall below 1, eliminating horizontal scrolling. 

To enable horizontal scrolling, I can set the scale to 1 always and wrap the content in an overflow container. It seems like we need to satisfy both dynamic scaling and horizontal scrolling, aligning with user needs.
**Preparing for horizontal scrolling**

I need to add a wrapper styled with `overflowX: 'auto'` and a width of either `100vw` or `100%`. The outermost structure is a grid container, so I'll include a scroll container. 

Additionally, I plan to remove any scaling below 1 and set the next scale to 1. The user's request for horizontal scrolling suggests we should keep the scale at 1, which will let mobile devices remain at a width of 1920 and be horizontally scrollable. Lastly, the scroll container will have its height adjustment logic updated while keeping the original height intact.
**Setting container dimensions**

For the inner container, I’m thinking of keeping the width at `DESIGN_WIDTH` pixels. I plan to maintain the scale at 1 to preserve pixel-perfect design. Even though there was a previous request for dynamic scaling, the user now wants horizontal scrolling on smaller screens and centered content on larger ones. 

I’ll implement this by setting `nextScale` to 1. I can also consider adding an option to prefer scrolling, so if `preferScroll` is true, the scale remains at 1. That seems like a straightforward adjustment!
**Modifying ElementLight.jsx**

I’m looking to adjust `ElementLight.jsx` to improve the layout. First, I'll add a wrapper with `overflowX: 'auto'` inside the grid container, but I need to ensure the inner container has a minimum width of `DESIGN_WIDTH`. This setup will allow horizontal scrolling on smaller viewports while centering content on larger screens.

I plan to set the scale to 1, removing any scaling logic that would alter dimensions. The height reservation logic needs to stay intact to account for absolute positioning. Also, removing transformations will help maintain the fixed header, ensuring it stays correctly positioned. That seems essential for a smooth user experience!
**Updating layout adjustments**

I see that I need to remove the scale transform and scaling state while keeping the `contentRef` for height measurement. I’ll change the wrapper to have `overflowX: auto`, which should support horizontal scrolling. 

It seems like I don’t need to add `overflowY`, and I’ll leave the CSS adjustments for natural vertical scrolling as is. After I apply these code changes, I’ll test the dev server. I'll also create a new task in the todo list for enabling horizontal scrolling in the fixed-width layout, marking it as in progress. Finally, I’ll run the build to confirm everything compiles successfully.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Optimizing file reading and display**

Management suggests running tools in parallel when reading multiple files, but I'm only processing one for now. I should use `read_file`, then apply a patch to simplify the process. For better display, I can create a horizontal scroll by wrapping the `contentRef`. The outer wrapper should be `<div className="w-screen overflow-x-auto">`, while the inner track could be `<div className="min-w-[1920px] flex justify-center">`, ensuring the width matches 1920 pixels. This should allow proper horizontal scrolling without blank spaces.
**Adjusting scroller and layout**

I need to ensure that the scroller's width matches the viewport. If the viewport is less than 1920, it should allow scrolling; otherwise, it will fit without scrolling. Currently, the outer grid is set with `justify-items-center`, which could conflict with the scroller's alignment. I think it's better to simplify by having an `overflow-x-auto` container at the top level. 

So, I’d replace the previous structure with:

```html
<div className="bg-white w-screen overflow-x-auto" data-model-id=... >
  <div className="w-[1920px] mx-auto relative"> ...content... </div>
</div>
```

This way, content will center when the viewport is greater than or equal to 1920, but still allow overflow when it's smaller.
**Simplifying layout structure**

I've realized that using `mx-auto` on a 1920 width inside a smaller parent won't apply left and right margins properly due to overflow. In such cases, the content remains left-aligned, and the `margin: auto` doesn’t effectively center the inner content. To address this, I can remove the `grid justify-items-center` to prevent any centering conflicts.

I should simplify the structure by replacing the className with `bg-white w-screen overflow-x-auto` and removing unnecessary grid properties. Ultimately, I want to keep the changes minimal, focusing on making sure the top-level container effectively includes the `overflow-x-auto`. Now, it's time to fetch the file to patch things up!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Modifying for horizontal scroll**

I need to implement horizontal scrolling instead of scaling based on the user's request. They mentioned they want 좌우는 스크롤을 해야하는데? which translates to needing horizontal scroll. My previous update added scaling, but now I need to adjust that. I'll remove the scaling wrap and switch the container to overflow-x: auto, ensuring content width is at least 1920px. The absolute position elements should stay in a relatively positioned container for proper alignment. Let's make these adjustments!
**Implementing horizontal scroll**

For the horizontal scroll, I need to wrap the content in a container with `overflow-x-auto`, possibly using `w-screen` to match the viewport width. Inside, I’ll place a wide `div` set at 1920px. This setup allows for left-right scrolling if the viewport is narrower than that width. I should consider the fixed header; while it will stay anchored to the left, it may not scroll with the content. Changing the header to `sticky` or `absolute` might keep it aligned as the user scrolls horizontally.
**Addressing horizontal scrolling needs**

I’m considering that the user only requested horizontal scrolling, so I want to keep the header fixed for now. However, the fixed header set at 1920px might overflow the viewport, showing that it won't scroll with the content. This could lead to a disjointed appearance. A possible future improvement would be to change the header to `absolute` or maybe `sticky`, although getting horizontal stickiness right can be tricky. For now, I'll focus on removing the scaling logic and creating a horizontal scroll wrapper with the appropriate Tailwind CSS classes.
**Reviewing plugin and structure issues**

I’m unsure about the need for a plugin here, so I’m considering using standard classes like `overflow-x-auto` and possibly `overflow-y-hidden`, but we might want to keep vertical scrolling too since the content has large heights. The inner content will stay `w-[1920px] relative`.

I noticed some duplicate `</div>` tags causing structural issues after our recent edits. Specifically, there are mismatched closing tags between lines 225 to 230. I need to review this structure closely to ensure everything matches up correctly after inserting the wrappers. It looks like some nesting might be wonky.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating content scaling**

I'm considering the scaled content, which has elements with a width of 1940, and how transforms apply to the entire content, including its children. Luckily, these transforms won't cause overflow since they don't change the layout width. However, the content reference (contentRef) itself has a width of 1920, which could lead to overflow if the scale is set to 1 on smaller viewports. I set the scale to the minimum of the viewport width divided by 1920 or 1.
**Addressing overflow issues**

I'm thinking about how, on small viewports where the scale is less than 1, the width remains at 1920. This could lead to horizontal scroll since the outer container is at 100% width but still smaller than 1920. Even though transforms don't affect layout, they reduce the visual width, and we still see a scrollbar. To resolve this, I should wrap the content in a container with overflow hidden or adjust the display style. Using a wrapper styled to center content might help, too.
**Preventing horizontal scroll**

The user wants to match the width so there's no horizontal scroll, which I need to address. First, I should set the outer container to `width: 100vw` and `overflowX: hidden` to prevent scrolling. While using transform scaling works, it may not be fully sufficient if headers are fixed. I could simply set `html` and `body` to `overflow-x: hidden`, but since the user focused on fitting the width, we can adjust styles in `index.html` to ensure the scaling maintains the right content visibility.
**Exploring scaling methods**

I'm considering different methods to handle the scaling and layout. One option is to set the transform scale and keep the width at 1920 while also using `max-width: 100vw` and `overflow: hidden`. However, since contentRef remains at 1920, it doesn't help much. CSS zoom is inconsistent across browsers, so I'll stick with transform scaling. I can also wrap contentRef to have a dynamic width based on scale. The wrapper will keep its width equal to the viewport, preventing any scrolling issues.
**Refining layout and preventing overflow**

I'm examining our current code, which includes a wrapper `<div>` for contentRef. However, with the width set to 1920, this might cause overflow on smaller viewports since the wrapper is 100%. To resolve this, I plan to set the wrapper's CSS to `overflowX: hidden` and ensure it's centered. Additionally, we need to update ElementLight.jsx to recreate the wrapper structure with dynamic width based on scale. Also, I noticed some inconsistencies in our DOM structure with the footer and header placement; I should keep them inside the scaled container. Finally, I'll add global styles for overflow.
**Matching width and managing overflow**

The user wants to match the width instead of just hiding overflow, which I understand. While we scale down content to fit, it's crucial that no content gets clipped. To handle this, I plan to add the `w-screen overflow-x-hidden` class to the top-level container. This should help hide horizontal scroll issues, but I also want to ensure `body { overflow-x: hidden; }` is added to the index.html. I believe these changes will effectively manage overflow and improve the layout without any unwanted scrolling.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Calculating effective width**

I’m figuring out the effective base width we need to compute based on the scrollWidth of the actual content after it mounts. I’ll use DESIGN_WIDTH as an initial fallback, but if the content’s scrollWidth is greater, I’ll use that instead. To compute the scale, I’ll take the minimum between viewportWidth divided by contentRef.scrollWidth, or 1. The container's reserved width will be based on the current scaled width from DESIGN_WIDTH. To manage the initial measurement, I'll use ResizeObserver, though there may be a slight flicker initially, which should be fine.
**Adjusting the code**

I'm working on adjusting the code. First, I’ll decide whether to remove the DESIGN_WIDTH constant or keep it as a fallback. I’ll set a state for contentWidth initialized to DESIGN_WIDTH, which I'll update after mounting by reading contentRef.scrollWidth. In the function updateScaleAndHeight, I’ll calculate the width using contentRef?.scrollWidth or DESIGN_WIDTH, and the scale compared to window.innerWidth. I’ll also set the outer wrapper's reserved width accordingly. 

I’m considering how overflow hidden might cut off any content if the width is smaller but keeping the scaled width matching content width should prevent that. I need to confirm the correct transformOrigin—whether to use "top left" or "top center." If centering with auto margins works, I’ll go with that, but ensuring the header is positioned correctly is essential since it may escape the transform if the container scales.
**Understanding CSS behavior**

I'm analyzing how CSS transforms affect positioning. When I apply a transform to the parent, it creates a containing block, which means position: fixed elements inside will behave like they are absolutely positioned relative to that transformed ancestor. This means the header will be fixed to the scaled container rather than the viewport. 

Now, the footer’s using absolute positioning with widths of 1920 and 1940. Since the container has a width of 1920px, I'm wondering if contentRef might only be 1920 wide, but there are absolute items that could extend beyond that. I suspect the scrollWidth of contentRef will reflect the maximum scrollable width, likely including overflow from those absolutely positioned children. However, I need to check if it counts overflow correctly when those elements remain visibly outside their container.
**Measuring content dimensions**

I want to ensure I capture the entire area, so I’m considering measuring the maximum of DESIGN_WIDTH and known element widths. A simpler approach could be to set contentRef to a larger wrapper element that includes all content, even those positioned absolutely, although that might not account for overflow. 

Alternatively, I could compute the bounding box width using getBoundingClientRect() before any transformations. However, since transforms scale the measurements, I need to be careful. Although I can temporarily set the scale to 1, that feels messy. Instead, I think defining a child wrapper called 'innerContainer' with an explicit width of max(1920px, contentRef.scrollWidth, and measured widths) could be a more straightforward solution.
**Computing intrinsic width and scaling**

I’m thinking of another approach to manage the widths in my layout. If the container's overflow is set to visible, I could scale elements larger than 1920 down to fit, ensuring no horizontal scroll appears. I’ll effectively compute the required content width as the maximum of DESIGN_WIDTH, current scrollWidth, and known oversize values like 1940. 

I can programmatically query child nodes to find the maximum rightmost offset using getBoundingClientRect. To keep it simpler, setting the container width to 1920 plus an overscan margin could help accommodate overflowing elements. Notably, I’ll use a child wrapper with a width of max(1920px and contentRef.scrollWidth) to simplify overflow management, employing getBoundingClientRect for accurate measurements by temporarily adjusting the transform. 

I’ll refine my implementation by establishing a measureIntrinsicSize function, ensuring no flicker occurs, possibly by making the element invisible while toggling styles. I'll use state variables to track intrinsic dimensions and respond to layout changes dynamically. I’ll implement this, focusing on maintaining readability and performance while ensuring component responsiveness. Then, I’ll adjust the scale accordingly during resize events, guarding against unnecessary re-renders and infinite loops. Finally, I’ll apply the code edits, ensuring to run lints and maintain formatting conventions, then mention any fixes made during the process.
**Implementing the patch**

I’m preparing to patch the code to add an `intrinsicWidth` state, starting with the initial `DESIGN_WIDTH`. I'll modify the `updateScaleAndHeight` function to calculate `unscaledWidth` and `unscaledHeight` based on the element’s bounding rectangle. 

Instead of relying on the closure scale, which could get stale due to the empty dependencies, I’ll temporarily set `style.transform` to 'none' when measuring to avoid issues. After keeping the previous transform, I’ll measure and restore the original style immediately, ensuring minimal visual disruption. Then, I’ll compute `nextScale` and adjust the wrapper width accordingly, based on the new `intrinsicWidth`. It’s time to implement these changes!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Revising footer placement**

I realized that we closed all the wrappers before starting the footer outside of the main wrapper. That’s not right, as it puts the footer outside the scaled container. I need to remember that the content, including "header" and "footer," was originally inside the larger wrapper. It's important to keep everything organized correctly within the intended structure!
**Evaluating DOM structure issues**

I think our recent edits broke the DOM structure by placing the footer and header outside, which makes their absolute positions not relate to the scaled container properly. The "header" is fixed, but the main content might have vanished because scaledHeight is computed smaller than it should be. This could be due to absolute positioning leading to a getBoundingClientRect height of zero. The inner container lacks an explicit height, and since we have many absolute elements, that messes things up. It looks like almost everything has an absolute position!
**Analyzing height measurement issues**

I’ve realized that measuring the height using getBoundingClientRect on "bg-white relative" with only absolute children results in a height of 0. This makes scaledHeight become 0, meaning the wrapper height is also 0. So, it doesn’t show up due to overflow hidden. The scaled content might not be visible either. To fix this, instead of using measuredHeight, I could compute scaledHeight by measuring the outer content's scrollHeight. However, measuring absolute children could still return 0. Maybe I should determine the maximum bottom edge among the children instead!
**Revising height and overflow strategies**

An alternative approach is to avoid any height restrictions by removing overflow hidden and letting the transformed content overflow. I could set the wrapper's minHeight to match the scaled bounding box calculated from the outer wrapper's bounding rectangle. If the content uses absolute positions, we could find the maximum bottom by iterating through child nodes, but that’s tricky in React. Instead, computing from contentRef’s offsetHeight might help, although it typically ignores absolutely positioned children. A cleaner fix could be using a CSS transform for scaling and adjusting the width based on the design width and scale, but I also think I could simply compute "scaledHeight" from the earlier set height in computed style.
**Addressing height and overflow issues**

I’ve noticed the inner "bg-white w-[1920px] relative" doesn’t have height because we previously removed the "h-[1200px]" on the container. This likely caused a zero height, collapsing the screen. I should restore that height or compute it based on the bottommost element. Instead of scaling the entire page, it might be better to adjust the CSS to use responsive widths. 

I think removing overflow hidden and letting content overflow vertically will solve the disappearing content issue. The new wrapper structure should not set fixed height or overflow settings, allowing the content to be visible and scrollable. I’ll ensure we close wrappers properly, with header and footer correctly placed inside the content area.
**Fixing footer and header placement**

It looks like we placed the footer outside the "relative" container, which causes it to anchor to the viewport, making it potentially invisible or overlapped. Originally, the header and footer were siblings within the relative wrapper, but our recent changes moved them outside. We should move them back inside the inner "bg-white w-[1920px] relative" container.

To fix this, I need to restructure the code, removing incorrect closing tags and ensuring both the header and footer are included in the inner container. I'll also eliminate height and overflow hidden from the wrapper to help clarify content visibility. Let's implement those changes and make sure everything lines up correctly!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Troubleshooting content visibility**

I need to address why content isn’t visible. We introduced a scaling wrapper with a transform, but it seems like the scaled container height isn’t reserved because we removed the parent height. The original code was filled with absolutely positioned elements in the 1920 canvas, and now my new setup might lead to overflowing content. Since the outer div has overflow-x hidden, it may cause vertical cropping. Without a height set, the wrapper div could collapse to zero height if the scaled element is using absolute positioning.
**Examining container height issues**

The inner top-level div with the class "bg-white w-[1920px] relative" has absolutely positioned children, which makes its height not expand normally. This could mean the content reference's scrollHeight is likely zero. In the past, we measured height to set scaledHeight, but now we've removed a height, possibly resulting in the container having no intrinsic height. The parent wrapper might not display because of zero height, but transforms can still render. However, if the container isn’t tall enough, the children may not appear as expected.
**Analyzing measurement methods**

It seems we might be using getBoundingClientRect after temporarily removing the transform. For a relative container with absolutely positioned children, its height is determined either by an explicitly set height or the actual content. If there's no inherent height, the bounding client rect could be zero. In the original code, the div had a height of 1200px, which we removed in the first edit. Now, the container likely has zero height since the absolutely positioned children aren't counted.
**Resolving visibility issues**

It looks like the content may not appear because the element has a height of zero. Absolutely positioned children can still be visible, but within the transform scale wrapper, cropping might occur due to the wrapper not reserving height. Since the wrapper width is set but height isn't, nothing could display. To resolve this, I think the best solution is to restore an explicit height for the canvas or compute it based on the tallest absolutely positioned child. Alternatively, I could use a minimum height value to ensure it covers all content.
**Planning canvas size adjustments**

I think I can set the canvas container to have a minimum height of 7500px based on the footer’s position. If we use a relative container and add a tall spacer, we can ensure visibility. Since the height is zero, the scaledHeight was also zero, which has contributed to the visibility issue. 

We could estimate a constant height of around 7200px to accommodate all content and avoid disappearing elements. Using `Math.max` for width calculations will also help account for absolute children, ensuring nothing gets cut off. I'll implement these adjustments carefully!
**Implementing layout adjustments**

I’m planning to set measuredWidth to the maximum of `node.scrollWidth` and `rect.width`, which might capture the desired 1940 value.

I’ll also adjust the `transformOrigin` to "top left" to align the scaling properly and prevent cropping. The outer container should not have overflow-x hidden since they want to avoid horizontal scrolling; we can keep it as is.

To ensure height is reserved, I’ll reintroduce a scaledHeight based on the constant CANVAS_HEIGHT of 7200. I’ll implement these changes in state management and the update effect, while also maintaining the width and height properties for inner content. Let's write the patch!</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing container height issue**

I'm figuring out that the container's height is zero unless there's an explicit height defined. In the original code, there was 'h-[1200px]' on the inner div, but we changed it by removing the fixed height. This collapse to zero means the content isn't visible. The solution seems to be reserving a height of around 7000px for the wrapper. I’ll set the wrapper height style to include the scaledHeight, allowing proper scrolling.
**Ensuring proper layout settings**

I'm making sure to keep the 'DESIGN_WIDTH' and 'intrinsicWidth' in mind. I need to set the header to be fixed while also verifying that the closing tags are in the correct order. In the wrapper, I’ll set up a div to reserve space with adjusted widths and heights based on the intrinsicWidth and scaling. The content height must be at least the CANVAS_HEIGHT to avoid clipping. It’s interesting that the outer wrapper will set the height, which helps maintain the layout!
**Implementing height adjustments**

I'm planning to reintroduce height with scaledHeight in the patch. We'll keep the overflow-x hidden and apply the patch. I should propose to automatically run the dev server and suggest the user refresh the page, but I don’t want to overload them. I’ll make sure to confirm everything is properly indented for the React file and adjust the style object accordingly. After applying the patch, I’ll run read_lints and ensure everything is compiled. If needed, I can run the build command to be safe!
**Including status updates**

I realize we need to add status updates before making any tool calls; I think we may have missed that before. Previously, we used the "방금 ..." style, but now we should include a brief update before invoking any tools. It seems like a good change to make! I’ll go ahead and apply the patch to ensure those updates are consistently included moving forward. This should help keep everything clear and organized.</details></think>

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing layout issues**

I need to address the problem with the right edge being cut off. Currently, I'm using measuredWidth from getBoundingClientRect, adjusting the intrinsicWidth based on the scale. The wrapper's width is set accordingly, but I think the content's absolute positioning might be contributing to the issue. There are elements set with specific widths and positions that could cause a wider layout than expected. It looks like I need to reevaluate how I'm measuring dimensions and handling scaling.
**Analyzing positioning issues**

I see that the children elements are absolutely positioned with negative left values, which could complicate how getBoundingClientRect calculates the overall width. I need to ensure that the measuredWidth takes into account both scrollWidth and the dimensions derived from the rect. If intrinsicWidth equals scrollWidth, yet we're applying a scale, the transformOrigin being set to the top center might be causing the cutting-off issue. The wrapper width may be smaller than the visual width due to subpixel rounding or overflow from elements with negative offsets.
**Adjusting overflow settings**

I've realized that we previously set the wrapper's overflow to not be hidden, yet the root div still has overflow-x-hidden, which hides any overflow on the right from transformation. To ensure everything fits without horizontal scrolling, we might need to shrink the scale so the content width fits the viewport fully. However, cutting is still an issue since the wrapper uses overflow hidden. Easiest fix? Removing overflow-x-hidden could introduce a slight horizontal scroll. I’ll consider adjusting the CSS to set the wrapper width fully without cropping.
**Adjusting transform origin and overflow**

I've realized that setting transformOrigin to top left instead of top center could prevent the right edge from getting clipped due to slight differences in centering. If the origin is top left and the wrapper width matches ceil(intrinsicWidth * scale), there shouldn't be clipping. 

Modifying the root's overflow to overflow-x-visible could also help, since we want to avoid horizontal scroll. If the scale keeps the width within the viewport, we might adjust for rounding by using nextScale or applying maxWidth: 100vw to the wrapper to ensure no overflow.
**Resolving clipping issues**

I need to investigate elements with widths exceeding 1920 px, considering our measuredWidth uses node.scrollWidth while contentRef's width is set to intrinsicWidth. We set transform to none for measurements, and the header being fixed could be causing issues as it behaves relative to the viewport, not the scaled container.

To avoid clipping, I’ll adjust the transformOrigin to top left, set the wrapper width appropriately, remove overflow-x-hidden, and ensure the scaled width fits within the viewport. Centering can be done using flexbox, allowing the wrapped content to fit properly without margin issues.
**Implementing design adjustments**

Currently, the top-level wrapper has a width of 100%, leading to left alignment instead of center, which might be okay to avoid cropping. However, I'll ensure there's no margin set on contentRef since the parent flex container will handle centering. 

I'll make some updates: remove overflow-x-hidden from the root, set the outer container to display flex with justifyContent center, and adjust the nextScale calculation. Also, I’ll include status updates for tool calls and manage any TODOs if needed. Let’s apply the patch with these modifications!</details></think>
